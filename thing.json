Standard treatments consist of non-specific chemotherapy and/or bone marrow transplantation, which are frequently associated with significant side effects, including life-threatening infections, bleeding, kidney dysfunction and even death. This project seeks to develop a drug targeted to the specific causal genetic abnormality responsible for CBF leukemia, with the aim of significant improvement in survival and reduced complications compared with current treatments.","Summary":"Leukemia is a bone marrow cancer involving developing white blood cells and often is associated with specific, recurrent chromosome translocations and inversions that generate fusion genes, which play critical roles in leukemogenesis.\n\nIn this project, targeted treatments are being developed for a subgroup of leukemia based on current understanding of how leukemia develops at the molecular level. The core binding factor (CBF) subgroup of leukemia contains CBF fusion genes that have been shown to play critical roles in leukemia development. Current treatments for CBF leukemia are not optimal, with long-term survival at 50 percent. The research team conducted a small chemical library screen to find inhibitors that block CBF protein interactions. Through biochemical, cell culture and animal model studies, they identified three chemically related lead compounds. In particular, one of the three compounds has shown leukemia reduction capability similar to standard chemotherapy drugs in preliminary studies in a mouse CBF leukemia model. The researchers will complete efficacy studies in this mouse model, develop one or more backup compounds, optimize formulation, and perform pharmacokinetics and toxicology tests that will lead to clinical trials. \n\nTRND researchers have successfully optimized and demonstrated the utility of the animal disease model. TRND scientists have performed medicinal chemistry optimization to identify a compound with significantly improved pharmacokinetics and tolerability after repeat dosing in mice. In addition, the collaborator developed an improved in vitro efficacy assay, using cells extracted from bone marrow. This assay was used to conduct an in vitro efficacy profile with the optimized compound, with subsequent evaluation in the animal disease model planned. TRND will conduct the necessary studies to support filing an Investigational New Drug application with the Food and Drug Administration. \n"},{"Report Title":"LUM-001 as a Treatment for Creatine Transporter Deficiency","NIH Project ID":"","ZIA ID Number":"TR000006-04","NCATS Division":"","2018 Project Status ":"Active","2019 Project Status ":"","Lead Investigators":["Ottinger, Elizabeth"],"Supervisor of Record":["Simeonov, Anton"],"NCATS Team Members":["Alimardanov, Asaf","Jin, Haksong","Sun, Wei","Terse, Pramod","Toney, London","Qiu, Amy","Xu, Xin","Zheng, Wei"],"Intramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":["Bianconi, Simona"],"Extramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":"Chris Bemben Lumos Pharma, Inc.\nAleksandra Bruchey Lumos Pharma, Inc.\nRobert Davis Lumos Pharma, Inc.\nMinh-Ha Do Lumos Pharma, Inc.\nRichard Hawkins Lumos Pharma, Inc.\nDavid Weiner Lumos Pharma, Inc.\n","Does project use human cells, human subjects or human tissues?":"Human subject research\nHuman subject research: Minors\n","Keywords":"Orphan Drug; Drug Development; Neurosciences; Brain Disorders; Rare Diseases; Creatine Transporter Deficiency","Distinguishing Keyword":"","Goals and Objectives":"Creatine serves as a crucial energy source in the brain, and it is delivered to brain tissue by a specialized transport protein.

There are no U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved disease-modifying therapies. This bone formation is initiated by inappropriate activation of the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) pathway. The lead collaborator has identified a compound that inhibits this spurious activation of the BMP pathway. The goal of this project is to develop this early-stage inhibitor compound into a drug that may be taken orally and to perform the studies needed for testing in FOP patients.","Summary":"Heterotopic ossification (HO), the formation of ectopic bone in skeletal muscle and other connective tissues, is an important cause of morbidity from joint immobility and pain. Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP), a rare form of HO, is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and is typically associated with activating mutations in Acvr1, the gene encoding the BMP type I receptor, ALK2. Individuals with FOP only have minimal skeletal abnormalities at birth, but extensive HO affecting nearly all skeletal muscles, ligaments and fascia is triggered after birth by traumatic injury or inflammation. No effective treatments currently exist for FOP patients, and disease progression results in severe restriction of joint function and premature mortality.\n\nIn 2008, the principal collaborators identified the first small molecule inhibitor of BMP signaling. The compound, dorsomorphin, blocks BMP signaling by inhibiting BMP type I receptors. Dorsomorphin derivatives were developed through initial medicinal chemistry optimization. The overall objective of this research is to advance the development of a dorsomorphin derivative in preparation for clinical testing in patients with FOP. \n\nThe TRND researchers determined that the initial lead molecule was unsuitable for further preclinical development. As such, TRND scientists performed medicinal chemistry optimization, synthesizing and evaluating with the collaborator over 1000 compounds in vitro. This led to the identification of a compound suitable for formal preclinical development, as well as an additional compound as a back-up. Activities in the lead optimization and development candidate selection included measuring compound efficacy against BMP signaling, assessing specificity and drug-like properties in vitro, and evaluating efficacy and tolerability in vivo."},{"Report Title":"Repurposing an EU Therapeutic for Hemoglobinopathies","NIH Project ID":"","ZIA ID Number":"TR000010-04","NCATS Division":"","2018 Project Status ":"Active","2019 Project Status ":"","Lead Investigators":["Haugabook, Sharie"],"Supervisor of Record":["Simeonov, Anton"],"NCATS Team Members":["Alimardanov, Asaf","Jin, Haksong","Tawa, Gregory","Terse, Pramod","Toney, London","Qiu, Amy","Xu, Xin","Zheng, Wei"],"Intramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":["indicated, none"],"Extramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":"Douglas Faller Phoenicia Biosciences, Inc.\nSusan Perrine Phoenicia Biosciences, Inc.\n","Does project use human cells, human subjects or human tissues?":"Neither human cells nor tissues\n","Keywords":"Rare Diseases; Neglected Diseases; Orphan Drug; Drug Development; Hematology; Blood Disorders; Hemoglobin; Sickle Cell Disease; Thalassemia","Distinguishing Keyword":"","Goals and Objectives":"The most common global genetic diseases beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease (SCD) are caused by defects in one part (beta-globin) of hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body. These hemoglobin disorders, called hemoglobinopathies, can result in moderate-to-severe anemia, with symptoms ranging from weakness and fatigue to damage to the heart, brain, lungs and other organs. These symptoms can cause chronic disabilities and early death. No drugs are approved to treat the underlying causes of these disorders. The lead collaborator has identified a drug that is currently approved in the European Union to treat another condition that has the potential to treat beta-thalassemia and SCD. The goal of this project is to develop this existing drug as an effective therapy targeted at the underlying cause of both beta-thalassemia and SCD.","Summary":"The oxygen-carrying hemoglobin protein (Hemoglobin A or HbA) is a tetrameric molecule, comprising two paired alpha-chain/beta-chain protein dimers. Beta-thalassemia is caused by mutations that result in insufficient production of the beta-globin protein, whereas sickle cell disease is caused by a point mutation in the beta-globin protein that causes the hemoglobin tetramers to form rigid polymers that deform the red blood cell, causing early cell death, abnormal adhesion to blood vessels and resulting widespread organ damage.\n\nHbA is the adult form of hemoglobin, produced mostly after birth. At earlier developmental stages, fetal forms of hemoglobin (HbF) are expressed. Importantly, these fetal globin proteins can replace the abnormal adult beta-globin proteins found in sickle cell disease and compensate for the absence of adult beta-globin proteins in beta-thalassemia. Although fetal globin expression stops shortly after birth, the drug PB-04 can reactivate expression of the fetal-stage beta-globin gene. This activation may lead to production of sufficient levels of HbF to mitigate the beta-hemoglobinopathies. The goal of this project is to repurpose this drug, currently in use in the European Union and Canada for another indication, for treatment of the hemoglobin disorders beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease.\n\nThe TRND team formalized and initiated a comprehensive preclinical project plan with a primary focus on beta-thalassemia as the first indication. The team has completed pharmacology and efficacy studies to recapitulate key data generated by the collaborator. The team received recommendations from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding the proposed studies required to support the filing of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application via pre-IND interactions. Pharmacokinetic, bioanalytical, and ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) studies are nearing completion. IND-enabling toxicology studies have been completed.

As an autoimmune disease, PAP causes patients to generate antibodies that attack a protein (GM-CSF) that is critical for proper clearance of these accumulated proteins and lipids. Current therapy requires lifelong, periodic washing of the lungs (whole lung lavage, or WLL) under general anesthesia, a risky and invasive procedure that is particularly problematic in children with the disease. This project seeks to develop GM-CSF protein as an inhaled therapy to stimulate PAP patients own immune cells to properly clear the lungs and thus avoid WLL.","Summary":"Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare disease marked by accumulation of proteins and lipids in the narrow gas exchange pockets of the lung, leading to respiratory failure. PAP is an autoimmune disorder in which patients generate antibodies against a normal protein found in the circulation (GM-CSF), which is a critical modulator of macrophage development. When circulating macrophages are impaired, they are unable to reach the lungs and clear the accumulated proteins and lipids. The goal of this project is to develop inhaled GM-CSF as therapy for PAP. As GM-CSF is currently used as an intravenous treatment for other conditions, the Food and Drug Administration has required the completion of a formal toxicology study to ensure safety before proceeding to further clinical trials in humans for PAP.\n\nA comprehensive project plan was developed by TRND and the lead collaborators at Cincinnati Childrens Hospital Medical Center. The team subsequently entered into collaboration with Genzyme Corporation, now Sanofi Genzyme, who are providing essential research materials to the partnership. TRND scientists supported extensive preliminary primate toxicology and dosing studies necessary to demonstrate the safety of using inhaled GM-CSF. TRND also supported formal Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) toxicology studies that enabled the lead collaborator to receive clearance from the FDA to initiate clinical trials.

We performed drug repurposing screens for drug-resistant cell lines of ovarian cancer refractory to multiple standard care chemotherapies. Several approved drugs have been identified that either suppress the drug-resistant cancer cells directly or re-sensitize the resistant cells to the anticancer activities of the standard drugs. We also found that diverse mechanisms are involved in the drug resistance of ovarian cancer, indicating the importance of personalized treatment which can be obtained from personalized drug screens using patient-derived cancer samples.\n\nUsing the cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cell line (IGROV1 CR), we identified LY2784544, a JAK2 inhibitor that overcomes cisplatin resistance in these cells. Further study found that the elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in these drug resistant cells increases IL-11 expression and further activates JAK2STAT5 signal transduction pathway to endow the ovarian cancer cells with cisplatin resistance. Thus, LY2784544 could be applied with cisplatin to treat patients with this ROS-IL-11-JAK2 mediated drug resistance (Zhou et al, Oncogene 2018). Another repurposing screen using the cisplatin-resistant SKOV3 CR ovarian cancer cell line identified Chk1 inhibitors that re-sensitize cells to cisplatins apoptotic effects. Subsequent analyses using the identified Chk1 inhibitors found that elevated DUOXA1 increases ROS levels and activates the ATR-Chk1 pathway to cause the cisplatin resistance (Meng et al., Cancer Letter 2018). In the third drug repurposing screen using another multidrug resistant ovarian cancer cell line (A2780-cis), several compounds have been identified that restore cisplatin's apoptotic effect. One of the mechanisms for one group of active compounds involves reducing the elevated EGFR level in these cells. In addition to the compounds having synergistic effects with cisplatin, several other compounds have been found that suppress the drug-resistant cancer cells directly (Sima et al., Translational Oncology 2018). These compound can be further studied for potential clinical applications. \n\nWe also performed repurposing screens against liver cancer and other gynecologic cancers, including cervical and placental. A number of active compounds were identified, and we are currently in the process of hit confirmation and follow-up experiments.\n\nLYSOSOMAL STORAGE DISEASE: We have performed drug repurposing screens using patient-derived fibroblasts for Niemann-Pick disease type A with a new high throughput instrument, the Mirrorball fluorescent cytometer, to identify compounds that reduced sphingomyelin accumulation in the patient cells. A set of 19 primary hits was found. Of these hits, 10 were confirmed to have relatively potent activities. We also carried out repurposing screens for Niemann Pick disease type C and Mucopolysaccharidosis type I using neural stem cells derived from induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from patients. The primary hits are in the process of being validated and confirmed using secondary assays and biochemical methods. \n\nDRUG RESISTANT BACTERIA: Infections with multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms have emerged as a significant worldwide public health crisis. The incidence is increasing, partially due to the selective pressure from widespread use of antibiotics in both humans and animals. We have performed high throughput screening to identify individual drugs as well as synergistic drug combinations active against drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii, both isolated from patients. Several synergistic drug combinations have been identified and confirmed.

We also found that diverse mechanisms are involved in the drug resistance of ovarian cancer, indicating the importance of personalized treatment which can be obtained from personalized drug screens using patient-derived cancer samples.\n\nUsing the cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cell line (IGROV1 CR), we identified LY2784544, a JAK2 inhibitor that overcomes cisplatin resistance in these cells. Further study found that the elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in these drug resistant cells increases IL-11 expression and further activates JAK2STAT5 signal transduction pathway to endow the ovarian cancer cells with cisplatin resistance. Thus, LY2784544 could be applied with cisplatin to treat patients with this ROS-IL-11-JAK2 mediated drug resistance (Zhou et al, Oncogene 2018). Another repurposing screen using the cisplatin-resistant SKOV3 CR ovarian cancer cell line identified Chk1 inhibitors that re-sensitize cells to cisplatins apoptotic effects. Subsequent analyses using the identified Chk1 inhibitors found that elevated DUOXA1 increases ROS levels and activates the ATR-Chk1 pathway to cause the cisplatin resistance (Meng et al., Cancer Letter 2018). In the third drug repurposing screen using another multidrug resistant ovarian cancer cell line (A2780-cis), several compounds have been identified that restore cisplatin's apoptotic effect. One of the mechanisms for one group of active compounds involves reducing the elevated EGFR level in these cells. In addition to the compounds having synergistic effects with cisplatin, several other compounds have been found that suppress the drug-resistant cancer cells directly (Sima et al., Translational Oncology 2018). These compound can be further studied for potential clinical applications. \n\nWe also performed repurposing screens against liver cancer and other gynecologic cancers, including cervical and placental. A number of active compounds were identified, and we are currently in the process of hit confirmation and follow-up experiments.\n\nLYSOSOMAL STORAGE DISEASE: We have performed drug repurposing screens using patient-derived fibroblasts for Niemann-Pick disease type A with a new high throughput instrument, the Mirrorball fluorescent cytometer, to identify compounds that reduced sphingomyelin accumulation in the patient cells. A set of 19 primary hits was found. Of these hits, 10 were confirmed to have relatively potent activities. We also carried out repurposing screens for Niemann Pick disease type C and Mucopolysaccharidosis type I using neural stem cells derived from induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from patients. The primary hits are in the process of being validated and confirmed using secondary assays and biochemical methods. \n\nDRUG RESISTANT BACTERIA: Infections with multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms have emerged as a significant worldwide public health crisis. The incidence is increasing, partially due to the selective pressure from widespread use of antibiotics in both humans and animals. We have performed high throughput screening to identify individual drugs as well as synergistic drug combinations active against drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii, both isolated from patients. Several synergistic drug combinations have been identified and confirmed.

We also found that diverse mechanisms are involved in the drug resistance of ovarian cancer, indicating the importance of personalized treatment which can be obtained from personalized drug screens using patient-derived cancer samples.\n\nUsing the cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cell line (IGROV1 CR), we identified LY2784544, a JAK2 inhibitor that overcomes cisplatin resistance in these cells. Further study found that the elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in these drug resistant cells increases IL-11 expression and further activates JAK2STAT5 signal transduction pathway to endow the ovarian cancer cells with cisplatin resistance. Thus, LY2784544 could be applied with cisplatin to treat patients with this ROS-IL-11-JAK2 mediated drug resistance (Zhou et al, Oncogene 2018). Another repurposing screen using the cisplatin-resistant SKOV3 CR ovarian cancer cell line identified Chk1 inhibitors that re-sensitize cells to cisplatins apoptotic effects. Subsequent analyses using the identified Chk1 inhibitors found that elevated DUOXA1 increases ROS levels and activates the ATR-Chk1 pathway to cause the cisplatin resistance (Meng et al., Cancer Letter 2018). In the third drug repurposing screen using another multidrug resistant ovarian cancer cell line (A2780-cis), several compounds have been identified that restore cisplatin's apoptotic effect. One of the mechanisms for one group of active compounds involves reducing the elevated EGFR level in these cells. In addition to the compounds having synergistic effects with cisplatin, several other compounds have been found that suppress the drug-resistant cancer cells directly (Sima et al., Translational Oncology 2018). These compound can be further studied for potential clinical applications. \n\nWe also performed repurposing screens against liver cancer and other gynecologic cancers, including cervical and placental. A number of active compounds were identified, and we are currently in the process of hit confirmation and follow-up experiments.\n\nLYSOSOMAL STORAGE DISEASE: We have performed drug repurposing screens using patient-derived fibroblasts for Niemann-Pick disease type A with a new high throughput instrument, the Mirrorball fluorescent cytometer, to identify compounds that reduced sphingomyelin accumulation in the patient cells. A set of 19 primary hits was found. Of these hits, 10 were confirmed to have relatively potent activities. We also carried out repurposing screens for Niemann Pick disease type C and Mucopolysaccharidosis type I using neural stem cells derived from induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from patients. The primary hits are in the process of being validated and confirmed using secondary assays and biochemical methods. \n\nDRUG RESISTANT BACTERIA: Infections with multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms have emerged as a significant worldwide public health crisis. The incidence is increasing, partially due to the selective pressure from widespread use of antibiotics in both humans and animals. We have performed high throughput screening to identify individual drugs as well as synergistic drug combinations active against drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii, both isolated from patients. Several synergistic drug combinations have been identified and confirmed.

However, systemic therapy often does not deliver sufficient drug levels to solid tumors due to inadequate blood perfusion and high interstitial fluid pressure in tumors. On the other hand, intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy has demonstrated impressive survival advantage in multiple randomized trials. Due to the lack of approved IP products, these earlier studies used IV formulations. This approach has two limitations: (a) the restricted drug penetration to the tumor periphery diminishes the efficacy of IP treatment in patients with larger tumors, and (b) IP therapy is associated with infection due to indwelling catheter and with toxicity from high local drug levels, which produces abdominal pain. These problems have prevented widespread use of IP therapy in spite of the demonstrated efficacy. Our aim is to overcome these limitations and to address the unmet need of products suitable for IP treatments.

In order to achieve this objective, various analytical techniques are utilized, which include the following: (i) Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LCMS), (ii) Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GCMS), (iii) High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HRMS), (iv) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy, (v) Semi-preparative purification, and (vi) Chiral purification. Additionally, we provide expert analysis to both intramural and extramural collaborators throughout all stages of a research program. Being an integral component of the NCATS research program, Analytical Chemistry strives to facilitate progress through meaningful scientific analysis. As such, we employ the best industry standards and practices in regard to analytical analysis, sample purification, and compound management. Furthermore, our goal of increasing productivity, efficiency, and integrity of the chemistry efforts within DPI involves the optimization of workflow, the integration of automated processes, and the implementation of a laboratory management system.

Major and minor components ( &LT; 0.1 percent) have been isolated for additional testing and characterization. The teams automated sample processing protocol allows for dispensing into 1D barcoded vials, Matrix 2D barcoded tubes and/or 96-well plates for efficient tracking, storing and testing. The entire process from receiving the sample to final plating is completed within one week. While the group uses a variety of liquid chromatographs to determine identity and purity, single quadrupole liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry instrumentation is utilized for high-throughput automated analysis. Due to the wide variety of analytes tested, the teams range of analytical detectors includes ultraviolet (UV), mass spectrometry (MS; positive and negative mode), and evaporative light scattering detector and fluorescence (ELSD). Time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF/MS) is employed to achieve formula confirmation and identity determination of unknowns.\n\nThe chemical and enantiomeric purity of chiral compounds is routinely determined within the groups full scale chiral laboratory. Methods development with the chiral chromatography screening protocol involves the utilization of various chiral stationary phases in conjunction with multiple mobile phase conditions. The use of an inline chiral detector allows for the determination of relative optical rotation. Sample purification on a scale of up to hundreds of milligrams is possible. We continued to expand our chiral column collection to meet the increasing demands of collaborators related to the type and quantity of compounds submitted for chiral separation. Furthermore, we are still working with the DPI Informatics group to incorporate vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectrometry into our routine workflow as a technique for determining the absolute configuration of isolated chiral compounds.\n\nThe expansion of DPIs focus beyond small molecules to alternate therapeutic modalities has necessitated an increase in our NMR and MS analytical capabilities through the acquisition and incorporation of more advanced instrumentation and techniques in order to detect, identify, quantify, and validate these new chemical entities. For NMR spectroscopy, this has involved the use of Residual Dipolar Coupling (RDC) and Residual Chemical Shift Anisotropy (RCSA) analysis in the determination of structural configuration and conformation. Also, peptides are being explored as highly specific and potent enzyme inhibitors and we have begun NMR analysis of these more complex structures. For mass spectrometry, we have purchased state-of-the-art instrumentation that will aid in high-throughput MS sample analysis. The Orbitrap Fusion Lumos MS system will enable us to perform top-down proteomics including post-translational modification analysis. This will be of great use for TRNDs newly established antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) screening platform, as well as many other projects requiring intact protein analysis. The Rapiflex MALDI system, which involves a collaborative effort between Biology, Automation, and Analytical Chemistry is central to DPIs imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) initiative. Lastly, drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a major concern in drug discovery research as most patients are taking several medications concurrently. Since it has been well established that cytochrome P450 inhibition can be a major cause for DDIs, knowing a drug candidates CYP450 inhibition potential is of great interest. As such, a collaboration with the DMPK group was started to develop a high-throughput RapidFire-MS/MS assay for cytochrome P450 inhibition studies in support of NCATS drug discovery research. \n\nThe Sample Management and Resource Tracking (SMART) system, our proprietary LIMS, continues to be utilized at DPI for sample submission, compound purification, compound processing, sample registration, compound inventory, sample tracking, data retrieval, and data management. As SMART is constantly evolving based on changing workflows and scientist needs, we have add required functionality while also streamlining user interfaces and the underlying scripting, which has led to a more robust and efficient system. We have continued our efforts of migrating SMART to a unified platform. Working with NCATS OIT, we have redesigned the user interface to provide users with a streamlined dashboard for comprehensive access to all project related data. Additionally, the SMART Consumables, Acquisitions, and Reagent Tracker (SmartCART) has been successfully transitioned to the unified platform. The higher level of integration coupled with expanded functionality has allowed SmartCART to move closer to becoming NCATSs primary system for the requisition, organization, and management of scientific related orders. The upgraded ordering system has been rolled out to DPIs current users with intended expansion to all NCATS in 6 months."},{"Report Title":"Toxicology in the 21st Century Program (Tox21) - Systems Toxicology","NIH Project ID":"","ZIA ID Number":"TR000038-04","NCATS Division":"","2018 Project Status ":"Active","2019 Project Status ":"","Lead Investigators":["Xia, Menghang"],"Supervisor of Record":["Simeonov, Anton"],"NCATS Team Members":["Li, Shuaizhang","Elizabeth, Caitlin","Sakamuru, Srilatha","Wei, Zhengxi","Zhang, Li","Zhao, Jinghua"],"Intramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":["Chang, Xiaoqing","PhD, Michael","PhD, Stephen","PhD, Jui-Hua","Kleinstreuer, Nicole","Shockley, Keith","Witt, Kristine"],"Extramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":"Richard Beger National Center for Toxicological Research\nShiuan Chen Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope\nSuzy Fitzpatrick FDA\nKevin Gaido FDA\nKeith Houck US Environmental Protection Agency\nRichard Judson EPA\nThomas Knudsen EPA\nHongmin Li Wadsworth Center, New York State Department of Health\nDonna Mendrick FDA\nGuo-Li Ming, PhD, MD Department of Neurology, Johns Hopkins University\nDavid Reif EPA\nAnn Richard EPA\nMichael Santillo FDA\nImran Shah EPA\nQiang Shi FDA\nSteve Simmons US Environmental Protection Agency\nHongjun Song, PhD Department of Neuology, Johns Hopkins University\nRussell Thomas EPA\nWeida Tong, PhD Center for Toxicoinformatics, National Center for Toxicological Research, FDA\nHongbin Wang School of Pharmacy, Univeristy of Maryland\nMaurice Whelan JRC\nDaniel Wilson The Dow Company\nVickie Wilson EPA\nFengtian Xue University of Maryland, School of Pharmacy\nHao Zhu Rutgers University\n","Does project use human cells, human subjects or human tissues?":"Neither human cells nor tissues\n","Keywords":"10K library; online screening; quantitative high throughput screening; toxicology; Tox21; Tox21 Data Challenge","Distinguishing Keyword":"","Goals and Objectives":"The Toxicology in the 21st Century Program (Tox21) is a federal collaboration among researchers from NIH, including NCATS and the National Toxicology Program (NTP) at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The mission of the Tox21 Program is to develop more efficient and less time-consuming approaches to evaluate the effect of environmental chemicals on human health.

These agencies work together to advance in vitro toxicological testing. The Tox21 Program is comprised of three NCATS teams: Systems Toxicology, Genomic Toxicology, and Computational Toxicology.\n\nThe Systems Toxicology team has identified, developed, optimized, and/or screened more than 19 assays. Highlights range from performing 5 online screens, including caspase 3/7 assays in CHO and HepG2 cells, human pregnane X receptor in triplicate and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme-based assay with or without metabolic capability in single against the Tox21 10K compound collection and 5 online validation assays, including enzyme-based AChE assay with or without liver microsomes assays, against the LOPAC collection on the Tox21 robotic system. All of these assays were optimized and evaluated before moving to robotic online validation and online screening. \n\nAChE is the primary cholinesterase in the body that metabolizes a key neurotransmitter, acetylcholine. Inhibition of AChE activity can lead to neurotoxicity and known inhibitors include organophosphorus pesticides, chemical warfare agents, drugs, and various phytochemicals. In collaboration with the CFSAN/FDA, the Systems Toxicology team has screened two cell-based AChE assays with fluorescence and color metric readouts in a homogenous format against the Tox21 10K compound collection. In addition, enzyme-based AChE assays with or without liver microsomes have been developed and validated against a group of known AChE inhibitors that need metabolism to become active compounds. In addition, the team has worked with NTP, EPA and FDA on the mitochondria project and tested 34 compounds identified from the primary screening in the follow-up assays including reactive oxygen species (ROS), p53 and Nrf2/ARE (antioxidant response element), mitochondrial oxygen consumption, Parkin translocation, and larval development and ATP status in the C. elegans. Known mitochondrial complex inhibitors (e.g., rotenone) and un-couplers (e.g., chlorfenapyr), as well as potential novel complex inhibitors and un-couplers, were detected. The team has also optimized and validated in vitro co-culture angiogenesis assay in a 1536-well plate format by screening a drug collection contacting 2816 compounds in a high content imager. From the screen, many known angiogenesis inhibitors were identified such as topotecan, docetaxel, and bortezomib. Several potential novel angiogenesis inhibitors were also identified from this study including thimerosal and podofilox. Among the inhibitors, some compounds were proved to be involved in the hypoxia inducible factor-1-alpha (HIF-1) and the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-B) pathways.\n\nThe estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERR) is an orphan nuclear receptor (NR) that plays a role in energy homeostasis and controls mitochondrial oxidative respiration. In collaboration with NIEHS, we identified more than five agonist clusters including statin cluster based on compound structural similarity analysis (e.g., statins) after primary screening. We also performed follow-up assays (e.g., siRNA knockdown) we identified compounds that might act as endocrine disrupters through effects on ERR signaling. In addition, the team has identified a group of CAR activators and deactivators from the primary screening. Several follow-up studies including CAR translocation in human hepatocytes have been performed to confirm the compounds with CAR activity."},{"Report Title":"Toxicology in the 21st Century Program (Tox21) - Systems Toxicology","NIH Project ID":"","ZIA ID Number":"TR000038-04","NCATS Division":"","2018 Project Status ":"Active","2019 Project Status ":"","Lead Investigators":["Xia, Menghang"],"Supervisor of Record":["Simeonov, Anton"],"NCATS Team Members":["Li, Shuaizhang","Elizabeth, Caitlin","Sakamuru, Srilatha","Wei, Zhengxi","Zhang, Li","Zhao, Jinghua"],"Intramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":["Chang, Xiaoqing","PhD, Michael","PhD, Stephen","PhD, Jui-Hua","Kleinstreuer, Nicole","Shockley, Keith","Witt, Kristine"],"Extramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":"Richard Beger National Center for Toxicological Research\nShiuan Chen Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope\nSuzy Fitzpatrick FDA\nKevin Gaido FDA\nKeith Houck US Environmental Protection Agency\nRichard Judson EPA\nThomas Knudsen EPA\nHongmin Li Wadsworth Center, New York State Department of Health\nDonna Mendrick FDA\nGuo-Li Ming, PhD, MD Department of Neurology, Johns Hopkins University\nDavid Reif EPA\nAnn Richard EPA\nMichael Santillo FDA\nImran Shah EPA\nQiang Shi FDA\nSteve Simmons US Environmental Protection Agency\nHongjun Song, PhD Department of Neuology, Johns Hopkins University\nRussell Thomas EPA\nWeida Tong, PhD Center for Toxicoinformatics, National Center for Toxicological Research, FDA\nHongbin Wang School of Pharmacy, Univeristy of Maryland\nMaurice Whelan JRC\nDaniel Wilson The Dow Company\nVickie Wilson EPA\nFengtian Xue University of Maryland, School of Pharmacy\nHao Zhu Rutgers University\n","Does project use human cells, human subjects or human tissues?":"Neither human cells nor tissues\n","Keywords":"10K library; online screening; quantitative high throughput screening; toxicology; Tox21; Tox21 Data Challenge","Distinguishing Keyword":"","Goals and Objectives":"The Toxicology in the 21st Century Program (Tox21) is a federal collaboration among researchers from NIH, including NCATS and the National Toxicology Program (NTP) at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

The mission of the Tox21 Program is to develop more efficient and less time-consuming approaches to predict how chemicals may affect human health. The main focus of the Tox21 Program is to help prioritize chemicals for more extensive testing using secondary and lower throughput methods including traditional in vivo methods. The Tox21 Programs ultimate goal is to develop strategies for agencies to use in regulating chemicals and reducing the current reliance on animal testing for toxicological evaluations. To carry out this mission, the goals of the Tox21 Program are to: (1) identify environmental chemicals that lead to biological responses and determine their mechanisms of action on biological systems, (2) prioritize the testing compounds for more extensive toxicological evaluation, (3) develop models that predict chemicals adverse health effects in humans, and (4) annotate all human biochemical pathways and design assays (tests) that can measure these pathways responses to chemicals.

Specifically, the Tox21 Computational Toxicology team contributes to quantitative high-throughput screening data processing and interpretation and to the development and implementation of software tools and algorithms that facilitate Tox21s data pipeline. Their main goals are to evaluate assay performance for prioritization, analyze compound toxicity profiling data to generate hypotheses on compound mechanisms of toxicity, and build predictive models for in vivo toxicity. In addition, they strive to integrate biological pathway information and assay data that allow the entire Tox21 Program to systematically analyze and model toxicity responses and to design assays that can measure the chemical responses of these pathways.

The Tox21 Program can be separated into three distinct areas of specialties: Systems Toxicology, Genomic Toxicology, and Computational Toxicology. Specifically, the Tox21 Computational Toxicology team contributes to quantitative high-throughput screening data processing and interpretation and to the development and implementation of software tools and algorithms that facilitate Tox21s data pipeline. Their main goals are to evaluate assay performance for prioritization, analyze compound toxicity profiling data to generate hypotheses on compound mechanisms of toxicity, and build predictive models for in vivo toxicity. In addition, they strive to integrate biological pathway information and assay data that allow the entire Tox21 Program to systematically analyze and model toxicity responses and to design assays that can measure the chemical responses of these pathways. Data generated by the Tox21 Program are submitted to the National Library of Medicines PubChem website, making information available for the public and other scientists to access free of charge.","Summary":"The Tox21 Programs federal partners include the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and NIH, with leadership from NCATS and the National Toxicology Program (NTP) at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS). These agencies work together to advance in vitro toxicological testing. The Tox21 Program can be separated into three NCATS teams: Systems Toxicology, Genomic Toxicology, and Computational Toxicology. The Tox21 Computational Toxicology team has enhanced a variety of tools that are routinely used by Tox21 partners to access each others data. The team performed data analysis of more than 18 assays that were identified, developed, optimized, and/or screened by the Tox21 systems toxicology team and gene expression data generated by the Tox21 Genomic Toxicology team. These activities include normalization and correction, fitting of concentration-response curves to generate potency and efficacy measures, classification of curves based on a set of criteria that included significance of fit (measured by p-values), completeness of fit, and efficacy, evaluation of assay performance by data reproducibility, data driven selection of compounds for follow up studies, and identification of genes and pathways involved in cell responses to chemical exposure. In addition, the Tox21 Computational Toxicology team has updated the web-based, automated structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis tool for the systems toxicology team to conduct SAR analysis on all 10K library screens. The Tox21 Computational Toxicology team has also updated the PubChem deposition tool to facilitate the deposition of the Tox21 10K triplicate screen data into PubChem. The 10K data from all assays screened up to FY17 have been made public in PubChem totaling 191 assay entries (AIDs) and over 85 million data points. \n\nThe Tox21 public data browser has been updated with the latest assay results from the 10K library screens totaling 54 assays. This browser provides the public with visualization of Tox21 qHTS data including concentration-response curves, curve fitting results and different activity metrics along with chemical structure and analytical QC results. Data are searchable by assay and/or chemical. Results from multiple assays and/or chemicals can be overlaid for ease of comparison. All data as well as assay descriptions and detailed screening protocols (SLPs) are available for download. The Tox21 data download site has been updated with new assay result files in the column format, combing raw data and corrected data, for ease of analysis by other Tox21 partners. The Tox21 Computational Toxicology team has continued to work with the Tox21 chemical working group to generate PDF files for the Tox21 10K library chemical QC results, including the 4-month compound stability test results. These results have been released in the public Tox21 Browser (https://tripod.nih.gov/tox21/) and the links to the PDFs have been provided for Tox21 compounds deposited in PubChem. In FY17, the Tox21 Computational Toxicology team has been working with other NCATS teams to update the NCATS Pharmaceutical Collection (NPC), which is part of the Tox21 10K compound library, with drugs approved in recent years to include an up-to-date list of all approved drugs. Furthermore, the Web based browser for the NCATS BioPlanet database has been updated including a tutorial page. The BioPlanet collects a list of all human pathways that allow the Tox21 Program to design assays to measure their chemical responses. The BioPlanet currently annotates nearly 1,700 unique human pathways by source, biological function and process, disease and toxicity relevance, and availability of probing assays. This tool has been made available (https://tripod.nih.gov/bioplanet/) to the Tox21 partners and the public in FY17. In addition, the Tox21 Computational Toxicology team has continued to work with the Tox21 Genomic Toxicology team to refine methods for concentration response gene expression data analysis including strategies for point-of-departure (PoD) determination, as well as combination screening data analysis of toxicants and modulators (the ToxMatrix).

Screening libraries continue to evolve as researchers gain a greater appreciation of the suitability of small molecules for specific biological targets, processes and environments. The decisions surrounding the make-up of any given small molecule library is informed by a multitude of variables, and opinions vary on best-practices. The fitness of any collection relies upon upfront filtering to avoid problematic compounds, assess appropriate physicochemical properties, install the ideal level of structural uniqueness and determine the desired extent of molecular complexity. These criteria are under constant evaluation and revision as academic and industrial organizations seek out collections that yield ever-improving results from their screening portfolios. Practical questions including cost, compound management, screening sophistication and assay objective also play a significant role in the choice of library composition. Our team continues to develop novel libraries including the Mechanism Interrogation Plate or MIPE and a novel stable metabolite library for use in both single agent and combination screening platforms.

O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) is an essential enzyme that catalyzes the attachment of O-GlcNAc residues to nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins including kinases, transcription factors, histones and many other proteins which, in turn, regulate numerous cellular processes. O-GlcNAcylation is still not well understood, and small molecule inhibitors of OGT will be a key tool for the dissecting of this important enzymes function in the cell. Working with the Walker lab (Harvard), we have developed a novel small molecule OGT inhibitor and validated its activity in several different mammalian cell lines without affecting synthesis of cell surface N- or O-linked glycans. We are continuing to optimize this agent and are pursuing numerous collaborations using this probe of OGT biology to delineate its role in multiple cell lines and disease settings."},{"Report Title":"Development of a novel aIIbB3 receptor antagonist for pre-hospital myocardial infarction therapy","NIH Project ID":"","ZIA ID Number":"TR000046-04","NCATS Division":"","2018 Project Status ":"Active","2019 Project Status ":"","Lead Investigators":["Thomas, Craig"],"Supervisor of Record":["Simeonov, Anton"],"NCATS Team Members":["Huang, Wenwei","Jiang, Jian-Kang"],"Intramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":["indicated, none"],"Extramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":"Barry Coller The Rockefeller University\nRobert Macarthur Rockefeller University\nMark Needleman Ekam Imaging\n","Does project use human cells, human subjects or human tissues?":"Neither human cells nor tissues\n","Keywords":"ST segment-elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI); RUC4; Anti-platelet drugs","Distinguishing Keyword":"","Goals and Objectives":"In the last several decades, there have been tremendous advances in hospital-based treatment of heart attacks. In short, more people are surviving myocardial infarctions. Unfortunately, these individuals experience significant morbidity and a lower quality of life due to the tissue death that occurs during the key hours between symptom onset and interventional therapy while under the treatment of a physician. Our team has optimized a novel aIIbB3 antagonist in collaboration with the Coller lab (Rockefeller). This agent currently is being vetted as a clinical reagent to be administered alongside standard oral aspirin in the pre-hospital therapy of patients with ST segment-elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI).","Summary":"There has been relatively little improvement in pre-hospital therapy compared to the dramatic advances in therapy after arriving to the hospital. The addition of a potent aIIbB3 antagonist administered alongside standard oral aspirin in the pre-hospital therapy of patients with ST segment-elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI) has the potential to decrease early mortality and the development of congestive heart failure during the next 6-12 months. This hypothesis is based on evidence showing that therapy with other aIIbB3 antagonists (along with aspirin) soon after symptom onset can abort the progression of thrombotic myocardial ischemia to irreversible cardiac damage and decrease mortality. Moreover, we expect a favorable safety profile since patients will neither be anticoagulated nor undergo arterial access in the pre-hospital setting, and the effects will wear off within 2-4 hours. The current aIIbB3 antagonists all must be administered intravenously, a major disadvantage for pre-hospital therapy. We currently are gathering the needed Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling data to advance RUC-4, a novel aIIbB3 antagonist, to human studies. Based on crystallographic structural studies of aIIbB3, RUC-4 was designed to be specific for aIIbB3 and to have a unique mechanism of action that not only prevents ligand binding, but also prevents the conformational changes in the 3 subunit induced by current aIIbB3 antagonists patterned on the R(K)GD sequence that have been implicated in causing thrombocytopenia and paradoxical receptor activation. RUC-4 was also designed to have high solubility (80 mg/ml) so that the likely human dose (1 mg/kg) can be administered in 1 ml by autoinjector. Based on studies in mice and non-human primates, RUC-4 is rapidly absorbed after intramuscular injection. In non-human primates, platelet aggregation was eliminated within 15 minutes after a 0.27 ml IM dose of 1.93 mg/kg with partial return of platelet aggregation after 4.5 hours. A lower dose (0.47 ml; 1 mg/kg) produced partial inhibition of aggregation at 15 minutes, complete inhibition at 30 minutes, and partial return of aggregation at 2 hours. Thus, the current profile for RUC4 matches the anticipated needs for a pre-hospital therapy of patients with ST segment-elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI)."},{"Report Title":"HTS enabled examination of drug combinations","NIH Project ID":"","ZIA ID Number":"TR000047-04","NCATS Division":"","2018 Project Status ":"Active","2019 Project Status ":"","Lead Investigators":["Thomas, Craig"],"Supervisor of Record":["Simeonov, Anton"],"NCATS Team Members":["Ceribelli, Michele","Davis, Mindy","Duveau, Damien","Ferrer-Alegre, Marc","Goldlust, Ian","Gormally, Michael","Guha, Rajarshi","Kasbekar, Monica","Klumpp, Carleen","McKnight, Crystal","Michael, Samuel","Mierzwa, Timothy","Shinn, Paul","Wilson, Kelli","Zhang, Xiaohu"],"Intramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":["MD, Javed","PhD, David","PhD, Beverly","Rudloff, Udo","Ryan, Brid","MD, Louis","PhD, Xinzhuan"],"Extramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":"Shankar Balasubramanian University of Cambridge\nJaishri Blakeley Johns Hopkins\nJames Brenton University of Cambridge, UK\nSteve Fesik Vanderbilt\nAdam Renslo Univ California San Francisco\nPaul D Roepe, PhD Department of Chemistry and Program in Tumor Biolo, Lombardi Cancer Center, Georgetown University\nRichard Schlegel, MD, PhD Department of Pathology, Georgetown University Medical School\nDan Starczynowski Cincinnati Childrens Hospital\n","Does project use human cells, human subjects or human tissues?":"Neither human cells nor tissues\n","Keywords":"Drug combinations; Drug Mechanisms; High-throughput screening; Cell culture models; Drug repurposing/repositioning","Distinguishing Keyword":"","Goals and Objectives":"A novel automated technology developed at NCATS has enabled drug combination evaluation in an ultra-high-throughput fashion.

The misfolded monomer is degraded by proteasomes, but can form toxic polymers that are removed by autophagy, and stressed hepatocytes are known to undergo apoptosis. The impaired secretion of AAT can result in serious lung disease in adults (loss of function), whereas the accumulation of toxic polymers in hepatocytes can lead to the development of liver disease at any age (gain of toxic function).

The misfolded monomer is degraded by proteasomes, but can form toxic polymers that are removed by autophagy, and stressed hepatocytes are known to undergo apoptosis. The impaired secretion of AAT can result in serious lung disease in adults (loss of function), whereas the accumulation of toxic polymers in hepatocytes can lead to the development of liver disease at any age (gain of toxic function). Importantly there is extensive phenotypic variability, implicating roles for genetic and/or environmental modifiers. With financial support from The Alpha-1 Project (TAP) and in collaboration with Alpha-1 Foundation scientific advisors we are designing bioassays to discover and develop new therapeutic interventions for AAT deficiency, which may provide general strategies to treat additional conformational disorders. \n\n"},{"Report Title":"Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) Disease","NIH Project ID":"","ZIA ID Number":"TR000049-04","NCATS Division":"","2018 Project Status ":"Active","2019 Project Status ":"","Lead Investigators":["Inglese, James"],"Supervisor of Record":["Simeonov, Anton"],"NCATS Team Members":["Braisted, John","Karen, Patricia","Martinez, Natalia"],"Intramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":["indicated, none"],"Extramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":"John Svaren University of Wisconsin Madison\n","Does project use human cells, human subjects or human tissues?":"Neither human cells nor tissues\n","Keywords":"Genetic disorder; Inherited disease; Therapeutic development; Assay Development; Peripheral neuropathies","Distinguishing Keyword":"","Goals and Objectives":"Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is a collection of inherited peripheral neuropathies with diverse genetic causes resulting in motor/sensory abnormalities, chronic fatigue/pain, and adverse impacts particularly on distal limb function.

Svaren). More than half of the genetically diagnosed cases of CMT are caused by a chromosomal duplication affecting a critical myelin gene, Peripheral Myelin Protein 22 (PMP22). Since increased expression levels of PMP22 cause this neuropathy (classified as CMT1A), the simplest strategy for treatment is to achieve a relatively subtle ( &LT; 2-fold) change in PMP22 regulation. Proof-of-principle studies have shown that reducing PMP22 levels leads to beneficial effects in rodent models of CMT1A. Therefore, we have developed novel assays for small molecule screening to identify compounds that effectively lower PMP22 expression and treat the root cause of CMT1A. \nWe have designed and functionally validated novel assays for use in quantitative HTS that accurately reflect the physiological regulation of the PMP22 gene. This work follows an iterative design-build-test model enabling integration of advances in assay technology with key aspects of the disease physiology to achieve state-of-the-art bioassays compatible with ultra-high throughput testing platforms. Our initial assay designs using PMP22 regulatory elements driving expression of reporter genes as a surrogate of PMP22 gene expression. Second generation assays now utilize the groundbreaking approach of genome editing to insert reporters at the endogenous PMP22 locus, which allows physiological regulation of the reporter in the native chromatin environment. The assays created in this manner will be able to identify both transcriptional and post-transcriptional (e.g. miRNA-mediated) effects. One of these assays is now in use at the pharmaceutical company, Sanofi-Genzyme in a parallel effort to identify novel chemical starting points for a CMT1A therapeutic. \nIn subsequent designs we incorporate a coincidence biocircuit reporter, developed in our laboratory to increase the fidelity of the assays by greatly minimizing the selection of reporter-specific inhibitors which can, depending on the chemical library composition, outnumber and confound selection of candidate compounds of interest. To achieve the ultimate goal of identifying small molecules that can therapeutically reduce PMP22 levels in treatment of CMT1A, we participated in an R21-funded project with an aim to perform a quantitative high throughput screen (qHTS) of the extensive molecular libraries small molecule resources at NCATS.

Consistent with genetic studies in Drosophila that indicate PINK1 functions upstream of Parkin in the same pathway, biochemical and cell biology studies show that PINK1 recruits Parkin to damaged mitochondria where Parkin can induce selective autophagy of damaged mitochondria . PINK1 is a kinase that has been shown to phosphorylate Parkin to trigger Parkin association with mitochondria. Parkin is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates scores of substrates on mitochondria. These ubiquitinated substrates recruit adaptors such as p62 to mitochondria that are thought to be key for initiating autophagosome recognition of damaged mitochondria. Parkin activity through mitophagy or alternative pathways protects neurons from a variety of stresses. In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that increasing Parkin expression improves mitochondria quality control and protects dopaminergic neurons from mitochondrial stressors associated with aging. As aging is regarded as the primary risk factor for sporadic PD, it is logical the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria is an attractive avenue for therapeutic intervention. We seek to discover and validate drugs that boost Parkin expression level and ubiquitin ligase activity to reverse mitochondrial dysfunction and neuron loss in PD."},{"Report Title":"Phenotypic Assay Design and Development for Rare and Neglected Diseases","NIH Project ID":"","ZIA ID Number":"TR000052-04","NCATS Division":"","2018 Project Status ":"Active","2019 Project Status ":"","Lead Investigators":["Inglese, James"],"Supervisor of Record":["Simeonov, Anton"],"NCATS Team Members":["Karen, Patricia","Kinder, Travis","Lamy, Laurence"],"Intramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":["MD, Curtis","Horikawa, Izumi","PhD, Xinzhuan"],"Extramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":"Songon An, PhD University of Maryland\nVania Broccoli Institute of Neuroscience\nJohn Clardy Harvard Medical School\nKanneboyina Nagaragu Childrens National Medical Center\nJohn Porco Boston University\nDavid Sherman University of Michigan\nGeorge Thomas University of Cincinnati\nDonald J Zack, MD, PhD Johns Hopkins Medical School\n","Does project use human cells, human subjects or human tissues?":"Neither human cells nor tissues\n","Keywords":"Drug discovery; High throughput screening technologies; Assay designs","Distinguishing Keyword":"","Goals and Objectives":"In collaborative relationships with the intramural and extramural community of scientists the ADST laboratory of NCATS enables drug discovery strategies for early-stage (gateway) translation.

Nagaraju (Children's National Medical Center) the ADST laboratory is developing a coincidence reporter assay to aid in the discovery of compounds that increase expression of the enzyme AMP deaminase implicated in the disease idiopathic inflammatory myositis (IIM). IIM is a rare autoimmune progressive disease that afflicts the skeletal muscle of patients. IIM is comprised of errors in both immune regulation and intrinsic muscle metabolism. AMP deaminase (AMPD) catalyzes the deamination of AMP to IMP. In humans AMPD activity is encoded by at least three genes. AMPD isoforms have tissue specific expression patterns in adults and stage specific expression patterns during the muscle development. Drugs which stimulate the expression of AMPD1 are hypothesized to reverse muscle weakness. \nDiamond Blackfan Anemia (DBA): In collaboration with D. Bodine (NHGRI, NIH) and G. Thomas (U. Cincinnati) the ADST laboratory is developing assay strategies as part of a translational research project for DBA a rare, congenital disease seen in all ethnic groups with a frequency of 7 cases per million live births. The diagnosis is usually made in the 1st yr of life, as a severe anemia that requires transfusion. Unlike other anemias, DBA patients have no reticulocytes in peripheral blood indicating a failure of erythropoiesis whereas production of the white cells and platelets are unaffected. For a small minority of patients, bone marrow transplantation from a healthy sibling is a curative therapy. For patients without a suitable donor a variety of palliative therapies that can prolong life into the third decade. Current treatments include corticosteroid therapy, which results in reduced growth and other complications, or lifelong transfusion and iron chelation.\nDiscovery of Drugs for inherited rare blinding retinal degenerations: Donald J. Zack, M.D., Ph.D., a Johns Hopkins researcher funded by the Foundation Fighting Blindness, is collaborating with Dr. Ingleses ADST laboratory in a public-private partnership aimed at alleviating and curing blinding retinal degenerative diseases. Together they are utilizing ADSTs expertise in assay development, chemical biology and quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) to develop assays and chemical library testing paradigms to identify drugs and compounds that have the potential to save and restore vision for people affected by devastating retinal diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in Americans over 50 years of age. The use of primary rodent retinal cells, a limiting cell type typical for typical HTS experiments, benefits from the low-volume assay technology employed in the Inglese laboratory at NCATS. \nDevelopment of a cell-based high throughput quantitative microscopy-based assay for glucose-regulating multienzyme compartment: In collaboration with S. An (UMBC) the ADST laboratory of NCATS is developing a 1536-well plate format high throughput quantitative microscopy-based assay for discovery of compounds that modulate the formation of a dynamically assembled multienzyme complex regulating glucose-derived carbon flux in cells. Given that glucose metabolism is the central metabolic pathway that balances the cellular needs for both energy and building blocks, the pilot screening of pharmacologically active small molecules for or against the assembly will assist to understand the biological significance of the assembly in the cell. In turn, extensive high throughput screening is anticipated to discover novel pharmacophores, which promote or disrupt the assembly in human disease models, for therapeutic intervention in the treatment of glucose metabolism-associated human diseases. \nExploration of novel sources of chemical libraries for antimalarial activity: To probe the biological activity of the stereochemical and structural complexity of novel academic chemical libraries and the chemical diversity of natural products extracts (NPEs) the ADST laboratory is testing the antimalarial potential of these chemical repositories. In a multi-investigator collaboration effort with D. Sherman (U. Michigan), J. Clardy (HMS), J. Porco (BU), S. Schaus (BU), A. Beeler (BU), J.K.

The molecular basis for the activity of these compounds is being investigated. \nAssays for the identification of small molecules up-regulating Scn1a gene expression. Dravet syndrome, a severe epileptic disorder, is caused by nonsense mutations in the SCN1A gene resulting in a non-functional protein. In collaboration with V. Broccoli (Institute of Neuroscience, Milan) we are developing mouse ES cells, capable of differentiation to neurons, containing a coincidence reporter biocircuit edited into the genetic locus encoding the alpha subunit of the neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel.

Harris (NCI) the ADST laboratory of NCATS is developing a 1536-well plate format high throughput laser-cytometry based assay for discovery of compounds that modulate the cellular distribution and half-life of specific p53 isoform in cells. The demonstrated functional and regulatory role served by 133p53 between cellular senescence and autophagy is relevant to both aging and cancer.

In collaboration with M. Hoon (NIDCR, NIH) we are developing and testing novel assays of the b-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) receptor, Npr1. Recently the agonist, BNP was shown to be required for the transmission of itch sensation between peripheral and spinal cord nerves. The Npr1 assays will be used to identify antagonists for use in pharmacological treatments of chronic itch, a condition that results in long-term unremitting urge to scratch that significantly degrades the quality of life for sufferers. \nSIRPa-CD47 Protein-protein interaction. In collaboration with T. Miller (Paradigm Shift Therapeutics) and D. Roberts (NCI, NIH) our goal is to leverage the broad potential of CD47 as a molecular target in a number of tumors to create therapeutics that protect normal tissue from chemo and radiation therapy while differentially enhancing the effects of these therapies on the tumor. We are currently reengineering a medium throughput biochemical CD47 ligand binding assay to a higher throughput system capable of screening a larger number of molecules.\nChorismate mutase inhibitors. In collaboration with J. Padia (PrimeTime Life Sciences) this project seeks to develop a quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) assay for the identification of small molecule inhibitors of chorismate mutase (CM). CM is an important enzyme found in plants and microorganisms required for the biosynthesis of the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine. Mammals cannot carry out the de novo biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids and must rely on dietary sources. Thus, a potent and selective drug-like inhibitor of CM would be a valuable antimicrobial agent, particularly for antimicrobial resistant infections.\nTargeting G proteins with small molecules.

These losses are related to the breakdown of the connections between different classes of neurons in the brain and the eventual death of many of these cells.\n\nAlthough important progress has been made in the understanding on the development of AD, the basic biology, the factors that influence it and the identification of therapeutics targets, few therapies, treatment approaches and preventive strategies have been developed. Studies performed by members of the project team, at the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, showed that the c-Abl kinase is activated in neurons exposed to amyloid-beta and in in vivo AD animal models; rats exposed to amyloid-beta hippocampus injection and the transgenic APPsewPSEN1dE9 mice.

Graves Orbitopathy (GO), also known as thyroid eye disease, is an extrathyroidal manifestation of GD with a prevalence of 25% in patients with GD. Although there are adequate therapies for Graves hyperthyroidism, mild to moderate GO is usually treated symptomatically whereas definitive therapy is reserved for severe, vision-threatening GO. Importantly, none of the treatment regimens for GD used today are directed at the pathogenesis of the disease. TSHR is the main target of TSAbs in patients with GD. The identification and development of small molecule antagonists that inhibit TSHR signaling directly by binding to the TSHR could lead to promising new drug treatments to antagonize TSAb activation of TSHR in patients with Graves hyperthyroidism and GO. In comparison to anti-thyroid drugs, small molecule TSHR antagonists have the advantage of targeting the TSHR directly, and therefore, the same drug could be used to treat both major components of GD, hyperthyroidism and orbitopathy. The main goal of this project is to develop a potent and selective small molecule TSHR antagonist that may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of Graves hyperthyroidism and GO and/or may also be useful as a probe for studies of TSHR function in extrathyroidal tissues.

Consequently, there is a huge unmet need for efficacious therapeutics with improved safety profiles for treating schizophrenia. Formative recent studies have documented that the side effect profiles of current antipsychotics are likely driven by 1) interactions with other drug targets, particularly other G protein-coupled receptors; and 2) kinetic parameters of compound engagement at the D2R leading to altered residence times for receptor occupancy. The series of compounds under development (e.g., ML321 and ML1946) have set out to address both of these concerns and one compound, ML321, has obtained highly favorable preclinical results. ML321 has shown global GPCR selectivity as it only acts as a D2R antagonist, albeit with limited activity at the D3R at high concentrations. ML321 has also been shown to be active and selective using in vivo models of D2R antagonism, and also active in animal models that are predictive of antipsychotic activity. Most importantly, ML321 does not produce catalepsy, which is a behavior involving impaired motor activity in rodents and is predictive of extrapyramidal motor side effects in humans (commonly produced by antipsychotics). The compound does have a relatively short half-life in vivo, however, primarily due to the inclusion of thiophene moiety, which may need to be modified in order to develop the compound into a therapeutic. Further, while the ML321 series is very selective (40-fold D2R vs D3R), a second series of compounds (ML1946) shows an unprecedented selectivity profile of more than 500-fold D2R vs D3R. Unfortunately, this compound series suffers from metabolic instability that may preclude its evaluation in vivo. This can likely be overcome through synthesizing additional analogs designed to limit its hepatic metabolism. The goal of this project is to optimize these leads into very selective and metabolically stable compounds for further development into novel therapeutics. The overall benchmarks for this project are the development of compounds that are stable, soluble, brain-penetrant, orally bioavailable, and active in animal models of antipsychotic activity.","Summary":"The goal of this project is to optimize these leads into very selective and metabolically stable compounds for further development into novel therapeutics.

Sunitinib is a molecule belonging to the same scaffold family as the original HTS hit molecule identified by NCATS, SU9516.\n\nDuring this period, docking and modeling studies were performed to select the most adequate place in the scaffold of the lead molecule to perform modifications. Several molecules were synthesized to test the hypothesis of the modelling/computational studies regarding the selective activity towards the production of integrin, while reducing the anti-proliferative activity. The synthesized molecules are awaiting testing.\n"},{"Report Title":"Identification of Inhibitors of the Lipid Kinase PI5P4Ka/B as Potential Anti-Cancer Agents","NIH Project ID":"","ZIA ID Number":"TR000230-04","NCATS Division":"","2018 Project Status ":"Active","2019 Project Status ":"","Lead Investigators":["Hall, Matthew","Shen, Min"],"Supervisor of Record":["Simeonov, Anton"],"NCATS Team Members":["Hu, Xin","Karavadhi, Surendra","Lee, Tobie","Liu, Li","Patnaik, Samarjit","Rohde, Jason","Shah, Pranav","Qiu, Amy","Xu, Xin","Yasgar, Adam"],"Intramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":["indicated, none"],"Extramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":"Lew Cantley Cornell Medical School\nNathanael Gray, PhD Harvard Medical School\n","Does project use human cells, human subjects or human tissues?":"Neither human cells nor tissues\n","Keywords":"Cancer; Screening; HTS; Small molecule; Lipid kinase; PI5P4K","Distinguishing Keyword":"","Goals and Objectives":"Phosphatidylinositol (PI) signaling has been shown to impact a large and diverse set of cellular processes including proliferation, survival, and growth; their dysregulation is common in cancer and other diseases.

Provide efficient distribution of the compound collections in response to investigator orders in support of the research needs of the intramural program and the scientific community In addition, the Compound Management staff operates in partnership with the Automation team. Using numerous types of sophisticated and automated sample management and liquid-handling instrumentation, these experts provide follow-up and dose-response library-plating services for NCATS screening activities. The Compound Management team acquires chemicals for small molecule screening and registers chemical structures into a hybrid commercial/in-house database. Using rigorous storage and retrieval protocols, NCATS experts prepare chemicals and disperse them into multiple vials and plate types. The team evaluates and implements novel technologies and methods and develops custom software and Web development solutions to achieve an efficient workflow. The objectives of Application Scientists are to: 1. Maintain and operate complex pieces of scientific instrumentation 2. Train users on proper operation and maintenance routines for this equipment 3. Assist scientists with the establishment and execution of complex protocols utilizing this instrumentation The Application Scientists are responsible for the maintenance, operation, and overall support for mission critical pieces of complicated instrumentation and their associated scientific function.

The Compound Management team works in conjunction with the Automation team to provide follow-up and dose-response library-plating services for NCATS screening activities. Systems supported by the Automation team include primary screening system, Tox21 screening system, RNAi screening system, the RNAi hit picking system for assay follow ups, and the High Resolution Biosystems (HRB) acoustic plating system. In the past year, we have also installed and begun to operate a Thermo Scientific Spinnaker plate preparation workstation used to pin compounds and dispense reagents into plates in a batch format. Together, all of these systems combined provide a wide variety of automation and compound plating tasks used to enable all facets of the NCATS intramural scientific program.\n\nThe primary screening system utilizes three robotic arms for plate transportation, a storage capacity of more than 3 million compound wells (approximately 2,000 1,536-well compound plates), and more than 1.5 million assay wells (approximately 1,100 1,536-well assay plates) to achieve a world-class screening productivity while maintaining the high level of data quality required by researchers. It also has the ability to run multiple assays in parallel. Center experts have developed custom software to monitor and control the system, in addition to archiving the complete process history for every screen in real time. The Tox21 screening system uses a single robotic arm for plate transportation and a storage capacity of nearly 1 million compound or assay wells (about 600 1,536-well compound or assay plates) to screen smaller scale compound libraries not present on the primary screening system and the Tox21 compound library. This platform is designed to complement the primary system, and it is easily customizable, allowing for the rapid integration of additional screening technologies.\n\nThe RSS team additionally provides screening system services to intramural programs within NCATS. The Tox21 screening system contains a single robotic arm for plate transportation and a storage capacity of about 1.5 million compound wells (about 1,000 1,536-well compound plates) and more than 1.5 million assay wells (approximately 1,100 1,536-well assay plates). With a pin tool and two acoustic dispensers for compound addition, four low-volume dispensers for reagent addition, and three plate readers enabling a variety of assay detection methods, this system can rapidly screen, in triplicate, the Toxicology in the 21st Century (Tox21) library of 10,000 compounds. This year, the RSS team was also able to complete the installation of the Hamamatsu FDSS plate reader allowing the Tox21 program to expand the kinds of assays run on the platform, in particular calcium channel. The FDSS itself was modified to include a custom 1536 pintool cleaner developed by IonField; which is a first of its kind using cold plasma technology instead of DMSO and other solvents to clean, providing both better data due to minimizing carry-over effects between plates and reducing the need for caustic solvents which in the past have damaged the instrument. NCATS experts monitor and control this system with the same custom software used for the primary screening system. The RNAi screening system has two robotic arms for plate transportation with incubators for assay plate storage and plate stackers to facilitate continuous system operation. A multichannel pipettor, low volume dispensers, an aspirator for plate washing, and two different plate readers support a wide variety of detection methods for this RNAi-focused system.\n\nRSS staff also continue to support the newly formed Stem Cell Translation Laboratory (SCTL). Various team members have provided a large amount of support with a vast array of equipment including automated tissue culture systems, flow cytometers, cell sorters, and high content imagers. Special mention should be given to the automated tissue culture platform which has established itself as a core capability for all NCATS researchers now with the demand becoming so great that another system is most likely on order. These resources require a tremendous amount of expertise to operate and maintain. In the past year, RSS has begun to act as a core facility for these technologies, enabling different biology groups to increase their capabilities. Related to the high content imagers, more high content assays were run in the past year due to the increased capabilities as compared to the previous four years combined.\n\nThe RSS group acted as the incubator for the NCATS Tissue Printing group. In 2015, the group established official funding through the Cures Acceleration Network (CAN) and is now more formally funded. We have two active areas of engagement: the creation of a skin model and the collaboration with NEI for the creation of a retina model. Both efforts have seen great progress made in the last year; and with the onset of official funding, a large amount of equipment has been ordered to increase the groups capabilities. This equipment is now primarily placed within the new 3-D Tissue Bioprinting laboratory space that was recently claimed by rearranging existing laboratory space to accommodate a common location. The group also has established two U18 cooperative agreements with external researchers at the University of Rockefeller and Columbia University."},{"Report Title":"Research Services Section (RSS)","NIH Project ID":"","ZIA ID Number":"TR000242-04","NCATS Division":"","2018 Project Status ":"Active","2019 Project Status ":"","Lead Investigators":["Michael, Samuel"],"Supervisor of Record":["Simeonov, Anton"],"NCATS Team Members":["Bonney, Charles","Butler, Kamaria","Derr, Kristy","Derr, Paige","Frebert, Shayne","Joseph, Michael","Itkin, Mikhail","Itkin, Zina","Klumpp, Carleen","McKnight, Crystal","Mierzwa, Timothy","Shinn, Paul","Simon, Michael","Travers, Jameson","Tuzmen, Pinar","Leer, Danielle","Wallgren, Linus"],"Intramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":["indicated, none"],"Extramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":"none indicated","Does project use human cells, human subjects or human tissues?":"Neither human cells nor tissues\n","Keywords":"Screening System; Tissue Printing; Automation; Compound Management","Distinguishing Keyword":"","Goals and Objectives":"Research Services Section (RSS) staff at NCATS work cohesively to provide support to the Center.

The Compound Management team works in conjunction with the Automation team to provide follow-up and dose-response library-plating services for NCATS screening activities. Systems supported by the Automation team include primary screening system, Tox21 screening system, RNAi screening system, the RNAi hit picking system for assay follow ups, and the High Resolution Biosystems (HRB) acoustic plating system. In the past year, we have also installed and begun to operate a Thermo Scientific Spinnaker plate preparation workstation used to pin compounds and dispense reagents into plates in a batch format. Together, all of these systems combined provide a wide variety of automation and compound plating tasks used to enable all facets of the NCATS intramural scientific program.\n\nThe primary screening system utilizes three robotic arms for plate transportation, a storage capacity of more than 3 million compound wells (approximately 2,000 1,536-well compound plates), and more than 1.5 million assay wells (approximately 1,100 1,536-well assay plates) to achieve a world-class screening productivity while maintaining the high level of data quality required by researchers. It also has the ability to run multiple assays in parallel. Center experts have developed custom software to monitor and control the system, in addition to archiving the complete process history for every screen in real time. The Tox21 screening system uses a single robotic arm for plate transportation and a storage capacity of nearly 1 million compound or assay wells (about 600 1,536-well compound or assay plates) to screen smaller scale compound libraries not present on the primary screening system and the Tox21 compound library. This platform is designed to complement the primary system, and it is easily customizable, allowing for the rapid integration of additional screening technologies.\n\nThe RSS team additionally provides screening system services to intramural programs within NCATS. The Tox21 screening system contains a single robotic arm for plate transportation and a storage capacity of about 1.5 million compound wells (about 1,000 1,536-well compound plates) and more than 1.5 million assay wells (approximately 1,100 1,536-well assay plates). With a pin tool and two acoustic dispensers for compound addition, four low-volume dispensers for reagent addition, and three plate readers enabling a variety of assay detection methods, this system can rapidly screen, in triplicate, the Toxicology in the 21st Century (Tox21) library of 10,000 compounds. This year, the RSS team was also able to complete the installation of the Hamamatsu FDSS plate reader allowing the Tox21 program to expand the kinds of assays run on the platform, in particular calcium channel. The FDSS itself was modified to include a custom 1536 pintool cleaner developed by IonField; which is a first of its kind using cold plasma technology instead of DMSO and other solvents to clean, providing both better data due to minimizing carry-over effects between plates and reducing the need for caustic solvents which in the past have damaged the instrument. NCATS experts monitor and control this system with the same custom software used for the primary screening system. The RNAi screening system has two robotic arms for plate transportation with incubators for assay plate storage and plate stackers to facilitate continuous system operation. A multichannel pipettor, low volume dispensers, an aspirator for plate washing, and two different plate readers support a wide variety of detection methods for this RNAi-focused system.\n\nRSS staff also continue to support the newly formed Stem Cell Translation Laboratory (SCTL). Various team members have provided a large amount of support with a vast array of equipment including automated tissue culture systems, flow cytometers, cell sorters, and high content imagers. Special mention should be given to the automated tissue culture platform which has established itself as a core capability for all NCATS researchers now with the demand becoming so great that another system is most likely on order. These resources require a tremendous amount of expertise to operate and maintain. In the past year, RSS has begun to act as a core facility for these technologies, enabling different biology groups to increase their capabilities. Related to the high content imagers, more high content assays were run in the past year due to the increased capabilities as compared to the previous four years combined.\n\nThe RSS group acted as the incubator for the NCATS Tissue Printing group. In 2015, the group established official funding through the Cures Acceleration Network (CAN) and is now more formally funded. We have two active areas of engagement: the creation of a skin model and the collaboration with NEI for the creation of a retina model. Both efforts have seen great progress made in the last year; and with the onset of official funding, a large amount of equipment has been ordered to increase the groups capabilities. This equipment is now primarily placed within the new 3-D Tissue Bioprinting laboratory space that was recently claimed by rearranging existing laboratory space to accommodate a common location.

The PBD spectrum, also known as Zellweger syndrome spectrum (ZSS), is a continuum of three phenotypes: Zellweger syndrome is the most severe, neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, and infantile Refsum disease. PBDs are autosomal recessive diseases with progressive and multisystemic symptoms including mental retardation, craniofacial dysmorphism, liver dysfunction, sensorineural hearing loss, and retinopathy. PBDs often present in early childhood, with the most severe cases demonstrating early-onset and death within the first few years of life. Most patients, however, present with more mild forms and may survive into early adulthood. Current treatments are palliative and focus on managing symptoms of the disease, while the diagnosis of unaffected children and efforts toward neonatal screening necessitate the development of potential therapeutics to reduce and delay onset of symptoms through improved peroxisome assembly and function. Objective: Through a collaborative effort with academic researchers studying persoxisomal biogenesis and long chain fatty oxidation, the ADST laboratory at NCATS has worked on the design and development of HTS assays for assessing and quantifying chemical rescue of peroxisome assembly in a fibroblast model system expressing a common genetic mutation. These assays will be used to interrogate chemical libraries at NCATS including a repository of approved drugs and collections of diverse chemical substances, as well as target-based bioactive substances potentially associated with this biological pathway.","Summary":"In collaboration with J. Hacia (USC), N. Braverman (McGill University), and pending postdoctoral support by the Global Foundation for Peroxisome Disorders (GFPD) and the Wynne Mateffy Foundation the ADST laboratory of NCATS is optimizing a 1536-well plate format high content automated microscopy-based imaging assay for the identification of phenotype-perturbing substances from NCATS chemical libraries.

Cancers that occur spontaneously in companion animals, such as pet dogs, often share many important features with human cancers. This research aims to apply experimental and bioinformatics methods to analyze multiple canine cancer tissue types and to identify relevant gene co-expression modules conserved between canine and human cancers. This will enable identification of relevant biochemical pathways, controlling transcription factors, and biomarkers suitable for experimental validation in both canines and humans, including the testing of new therapeutic candidates.","Summary":"Spontaneous cancers in dogs and cats are an underused group of naturally occurring malignancies that share many features with human cancers such as osteosarcoma, prostate and breast cancers, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, melanoma, soft tissue sarcoma, head and neck carcinoma, and virally induced lymphomas. Treatment of pet animals - primarily dogs - with naturally occurring cancer helps researchers better understand the biology of cancer and to improve the assessment of novel treatments for humans.\n\nThe National Cancer Institute (NCI) Comparative Oncology Program has a collection of cancer tissue samples from dogs that span five different histologies (mast cell tumor, hemangiosarcoma, soft tissue sarcoma, pulmonary tumor, osteosarcoma, lymphoma, and melanoma) with anywhere from 100-500 patients (dogs) per histology. Each patient has tumor and normal tissue, serum, plasma, whole blood, and urine. All patients are enrolled while treatment-nave and have clinical outcome data.\n\nRNA-Seq experiments on selected canine tissue samples from these tumor classes has been completed. Using bioinformatics analysis of the RNA-Seq data the team developed diagnostic biomarker hypotheses, identified important mechanistic genes, and proposed drug combination therapies specific to each tumor type. Ongoing comparative genome hybridization and resequencing experiments will determine the copy number and mutational status of the biomarker and mechanistic genes. Ongoing screening experiments will determine the activity of proposed drug combination therapies in canine cancer cell lines. Completed tissue proteomics experiments have shown that 56 out of the 72 proposed biomarkers genes code for proteins that are expressed in the cancer tissues. Furthermore the biomarker proteins show specificity to various tumor types. Ongoing blood proteomics experiments will determine if the protein expression and tumor selectivity carries over into the blood serum of the canines. \n\nSimilar analyses are ongoing using publicly available human RNA-Seq data. Biomarkers, drug combinations, and important genes that are found to be consistent across both human and canine analyses will then have the highest chance of being successful in a potential clinical trial."},{"Report Title":"A Protein Replacement Drug for Friedreich’s Ataxia","NIH Project ID":"","ZIA ID Number":"TR000250-03","NCATS Division":"","2018 Project Status ":"Active","2019 Project Status ":"","Lead Investigators":["Ottinger, Elizabeth"],"Supervisor of Record":["Simeonov, Anton"],"NCATS Team Members":["Alimardanov, Asaf","Chen, Catherine","Cradock, James","Tawa, Gregory","Terse, Pramod","Toney, London","Wagner, Erik","Qiu, Amy","Xu, Xin"],"Intramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":["indicated, none"],"Extramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":"Carole Ben-Maimon Chondrial Therapeutics, Inc.\nJohn Berman Chondrial Therapeutics, Inc.\nDavid Bettoun Chondrial Therapeutics, Inc.\nJennifer Johansson Chondrial Therapeutics, Inc.\nRonald Mark Payne Chondrial Therapeutics, Inc.\n","Does project use human cells, human subjects or human tissues?":"Neither human cells nor tissues\n","Keywords":"","Distinguishing Keyword":"","Goals and Objectives":"Friedreichs ataxia (FA) is a rare, progressive condition affecting multiple systems in the body. The disease typically begins in mid-childhood, leading to an inability to stand or walk within 15 years of onset. Patients experience progressive loss of voluntary muscle control and coordination, debilitating scoliosis (abnormal curvature of the spine), and heart failure leading to premature death by age 50. Some patients also develop diabetes and suffer loss of hearing and vision. There are no approved treatments for FA other than supportive care. The lead collaborator has developed a technology to deliver functional frataxin protein to patients. The purpose of this project is to support the development of this protein replacement therapy.","Summary":"Friedreichs Ataxia (FA) is a rare genetic disease caused by mutations that prevent production of the mitochondrial matrix protein frataxin (FXN), which functions in mitochondrial iron homeostasis, notably in the de novo biosynthesis of iron-sulfur cluster proteins. In its absence, free iron accumulates in mitochondria, iron-sulfur proteins lose activity and energy production fails through damage to the electron transport chain. The lead investigator has developed a protein replacement approach that uses a cell-penetrant peptide to deliver functional FXN to the mitochondrial matrix.\n\nProtein replacement therapy is a well-established approach to metabolic diseases, such as diabetes, lysosomal storage disorders and hemophilia. Work in patient-derived cellular and animal models has demonstrated that replacement of functional FXN using the peptide TAT can correct the FA disease phenotype. In a mouse model, TAT-FXN extends lifespan, corrects histology and biochemical defects, and improves cardiac and neurological function. Moreover, this TAT-protein delivery platform could be extended beyond FA, representing a technology with the potential to treat multiple mitochondrial disorders for which there are no current therapies.\n\nThe TRND project team are collaborating on the development of the recombinant fusion protein, CTI-1601, conducting additional efficacy and pharmacokinetic studies, and developing and validating the biochemical assays necessary to evaluate CTI-1601.

Because the ovaries and the fallopian tubes are hidden in the peritoneal cavity, most patients with OvCa develop symptoms late in the disease course, typically presenting after the tumor has metastasized. NNMT is strongly and specifically expressed in the stroma of ovarian cancer metastases (and in the stroma of primary sites in patients with poor prognosis). Due to patient tumor heterogeneity and the lack of recurrent, targetable genetic alterations other than TP53 in OvCa, targeting conserved stromal alterations such as NNMT represents a viable alternative pathway to effective therapeutics. Either alone, or in combination with other traditional chemotherapeutics, inhibition of NNMT provides a potential avenue to improve the survival and quality of life of patients with ovarian cancer.","Summary":"Members of the project team have identified a central role of the metabolic enzyme NNMT in the stroma of ovarian cancer. The target enzyme is highly expressed in the stroma of ovarian cancer metastases and is also expressed in primary cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Knockdown of the enzyme leads to a reversion of many of the features of CAFs and attenuates their ability to promote cancer cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. \n\nDuring this period, the project team successfully optimized a biochemical assay that was used to screen over 100,000 compounds for inhibitory activity against NNMT. Counter-screens against two components of the assay, and a related methyltransferase enzyme, were performed to filter out the false positives.

Bioprinting of architecturally defined and physiologically relevant human tissues is emerging as a key enabling technology for drug discovery. Bioprinting is the process of creating three-dimensional (3D) multi cell patterns of defined architecture using 3D printing technologies, where native cellular functions and viability are preserved within the printed tissue. Generally, tissue bioprinting utilizes the layer-by-layer, additive manufacturing techniques to create human, native tissue-like structures for drug discovery and therapeutic applications. Bioprinting integrates advances in tissue engineering technologies and cell biology with the development of 3D bioprinters, biocompatible polymers and hydrogels and non-invasive methods to validate the morphology and function of human tissues.

Bioprinted human native skin models can provide fundamental insights into the etiology of skin diseases as well as elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms in skin disease progression and discovery of treatments. Current efforts are directed to the bioprinting of consistent and reproducible human native-like dermis and epidermis layers of the skin using normal human fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Once this is achieved, we will introduce available disease patient cells to reproduce disease skin tissues that will be used as disease-in-dish models for screening. Currently have several collaborative projects using 3D Bioprinted skin tissues: 1) development of a psoriasis skin disease model (Dr. Angela Christiano, Columbia U); 2) development of a skin model of SCC together with a confocal reflectance microscopy for quantitation of disease phenotypes; 3) using skin models for permeability measurements (collaboration with FDA); 4) using bioprinted skin tissues for microbiome studies (collaboration with Dr. Segre and Belkaid); using bioprinted skin tissues to screen for toxicity (collaboration with NACTS Tox21 group).\nBioprinting of blood retinal barrier for a disease model of wet age related macular degeneration (wet AMD): Retinal degenerative diseases are the leading cause of irreversible vision loss in developed countries. In many cases the diseases originate in the homeostatic unit in the back of the eye that contains the retina, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the choriocapillaris. In diseases like age-related macular degeneration (AMD), it is thought that RPE dysfunctions cause disease-initiating events and as the RPE degenerates photoreceptors begin to die and patients start losing vision. Patient-specific induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived RPE provides direct access to a patients genetics and allow the possibility of identifying the initiating events of RPE-associated degenerative diseases. Three-dimensional models of the RPE, neuroretina, and the choriocapillaris are being developed using tissue bioprinting combined with iPS cell technology and fundamental developmental biology. Analysis of disease processes at the level of this entire homeostatic unit will likely provide more insight into molecular mechanisms of retinal degenerative diseases, as well as providing a native disease model for the discovery of new treatments for AMD. This is a collaboration with the group of Dr. Kapil Bharti at NEI.\nBioprinting of a blood vessel wall model for modeling Progeria and cardiovascular diseases: Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a genetic disorder that, although rare, has devastating consequences to the affected children. Those with HGPS undergo accelerated aging and have an average life expectancy of just 13.4 years. Patients with HGPS suffer from accelerated vascular disease, and death almost always results from coronary artery disease or stroke. Previous studies have shown a massive loss of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in the medial layer of large vessels in HGPS patients and animal models, suggesting a possible link between this SMC loss phenotype and the deadly cardiovascular malfunction associated with HGPS. 3D bioprinting techniques are being used to build and characterize a tissue engineered blood vessel wall system using HGPS and normal control iPSC-derived SMCs as disease-in-a-dish models for the discovery of treatments for HGPS. The 3D bioprinted tissue models of blood vessel walls in multi-well plates will be validated biologically and pharmacologically using treatment options previously described. We expect that this 3D vessel system of HGPS will be of great importance for future drug screening and therapeutic development for HGPS and age-related cardiovascular diseases, especially since the toxic protein that causes HGPS is also made in small quantities in normal individuals, and increases as cells approach senescence. This is a collaboration with Dr. Can Kao at University of Maryland, College Park, and Dr. Francis Collins, at NIH/NHGRI.\nBioprinting of tissue models for cancer metastasis: Metastasis is the process of spreading of tumor cells to different parts of the body and in most cases it is the pathology that leads to ultimate death in cancer. A 3D assay that recreated the human omentum using cells from ovarian cancer patients undergoing surgery was successfully used to discover compounds that would prevent attachment of tumor cells to the omentum, an early site of metastasis in ovarian cancer. We are currently using tissue bioprinting techniques to increase the relevance on the ovarian cancer metastasis omentum model by introducing additional cell types that are important for the tumor-microenvironment interaction in the omentum metastatic site, including vasculature, adipose cells and leukocytes. Once a native omentum model is recreated, we will study the growth of cancer cells and screen for pharmacological agents that prevent tumor metastasis. This is a collaboration with Dr. Ernst Lengyels group at the Universtiy of Chicago. In addition, we have initiated a collaboration with Dr. Rosie Kaplan (NCI) to develop a vascularized lung model to study breast cancer metastasis.\nDevelopment of quantitative tissue imaging technologies for screening. The ability to quantitate disease phenotypes in tissues will be critical to enabling the use of this diseases models for screening. Although histology is extensively used during tissue development, imaging techniques will be key to have the throughput required for screening. Efforts are ongoing to develop tissue clearing and segmentation protocols for the quantitation of per cell phenotypes in tissues using confocal fluorescence microscopy. In addition, a collaboration in on-going with Dr. Chao Zhou at Lehigh U to adapt optical coherence tomography (OCT) as a non-invasive imaging technique currently used in a clinical setting to microtiter-based settings to enable its use for screening of tissues.

Bioprinted human native skin models can provide fundamental insights into the etiology of skin diseases as well as elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms in skin disease progression and discovery of treatments. Current efforts are directed to the bioprinting of consistent and reproducible human native-like dermis and epidermis layers of the skin using normal human fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Once this is achieved, we will introduce available disease patient cells to reproduce disease skin tissues that will be used as disease-in-dish models for screening. Currently have several collaborative projects using 3D Bioprinted skin tissues: 1) development of a psoriasis skin disease model (Dr. Angela Christiano, Columbia U); 2) development of a skin model of SCC together with a confocal reflectance microscopy for quantitation of disease phenotypes; 3) using skin models for permeability measurements (collaboration with FDA); 4) using bioprinted skin tissues for microbiome studies (collaboration with Dr. Segre and Belkaid); using bioprinted skin tissues to screen for toxicity (collaboration with NACTS Tox21 group).\nBioprinting of blood retinal barrier for a disease model of wet age related macular degeneration (wet AMD): Retinal degenerative diseases are the leading cause of irreversible vision loss in developed countries. In many cases the diseases originate in the homeostatic unit in the back of the eye that contains the retina, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the choriocapillaris. In diseases like age-related macular degeneration (AMD), it is thought that RPE dysfunctions cause disease-initiating events and as the RPE degenerates photoreceptors begin to die and patients start losing vision. Patient-specific induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived RPE provides direct access to a patients genetics and allow the possibility of identifying the initiating events of RPE-associated degenerative diseases. Three-dimensional models of the RPE, neuroretina, and the choriocapillaris are being developed using tissue bioprinting combined with iPS cell technology and fundamental developmental biology. Analysis of disease processes at the level of this entire homeostatic unit will likely provide more insight into molecular mechanisms of retinal degenerative diseases, as well as providing a native disease model for the discovery of new treatments for AMD. This is a collaboration with the group of Dr. Kapil Bharti at NEI.\nBioprinting of a blood vessel wall model for modeling Progeria and cardiovascular diseases: Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a genetic disorder that, although rare, has devastating consequences to the affected children. Those with HGPS undergo accelerated aging and have an average life expectancy of just 13.4 years. Patients with HGPS suffer from accelerated vascular disease, and death almost always results from coronary artery disease or stroke. Previous studies have shown a massive loss of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in the medial layer of large vessels in HGPS patients and animal models, suggesting a possible link between this SMC loss phenotype and the deadly cardiovascular malfunction associated with HGPS. 3D bioprinting techniques are being used to build and characterize a tissue engineered blood vessel wall system using HGPS and normal control iPSC-derived SMCs as disease-in-a-dish models for the discovery of treatments for HGPS. The 3D bioprinted tissue models of blood vessel walls in multi-well plates will be validated biologically and pharmacologically using treatment options previously described. We expect that this 3D vessel system of HGPS will be of great importance for future drug screening and therapeutic development for HGPS and age-related cardiovascular diseases, especially since the toxic protein that causes HGPS is also made in small quantities in normal individuals, and increases as cells approach senescence. This is a collaboration with Dr. Can Kao at University of Maryland, College Park, and Dr. Francis Collins, at NIH/NHGRI.\nBioprinting of tissue models for cancer metastasis: Metastasis is the process of spreading of tumor cells to different parts of the body and in most cases it is the pathology that leads to ultimate death in cancer. A 3D assay that recreated the human omentum using cells from ovarian cancer patients undergoing surgery was successfully used to discover compounds that would prevent attachment of tumor cells to the omentum, an early site of metastasis in ovarian cancer. We are currently using tissue bioprinting techniques to increase the relevance on the ovarian cancer metastasis omentum model by introducing additional cell types that are important for the tumor-microenvironment interaction in the omentum metastatic site, including vasculature, adipose cells and leukocytes. Once a native omentum model is recreated, we will study the growth of cancer cells and screen for pharmacological agents that prevent tumor metastasis.

Emetine potently inhibits ZIKV and EBOV infection with a low nanomolar half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) in vitro and potent activity in animal models of ZIKV and Ebola virus infection. We also found two mechanisms of action for this drug, including the inhibition of ZIKV NS5 polymerase activity and disruption of lysosomal function. In addition, emetine inhibits EBOV entry into human cells. We also found that cephaeline, a desmethyl analog of emetine, exhibits a similar efficacy against both ZIKV and Ebola virus. Cephaeline may be more tolerable to patients than emetine with fewer adverse effects. Therefore, both emetine and cephaeline may have the potential to be advanced to clinical trials to treat infections caused by both ZIKV and Ebola virus. We have collaborated with Drs. Alexey Terskikh (Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute), Hengli Tang (Florida State University) and Xiangguo Qiu (National Microbiology Laboratory, Public Health Agency of Canada) to test both emetine and cephaeline in the mouse models of ZIKV and Ebola virus infection.

This work led to the identification of a number of new active compounds that suppressed ZIKV replication in cells. Further experiments confirmed about 20 selected compounds with inhibitory activities against ZIKV replication. These newly identified compounds, including known bioactive compounds and compounds with novel structures, showed potent inhibition of Zika viral replication. Because ZIKV and Dengue virus belong to the same flavivirus family, we tested these new compounds and found inhibitory activities against Dengue virus replication in a virus titer assay. These compounds can be potentially developed into new antiviral therapies against both ZIKV and Dengue virus infections. We are continuing to work on testing and optimizing these compounds, with the aim of further preclinical development.\n\nFrom our previous drug repurposing screen, Niclosamide, an anthelminthic drug, was found to inhibit ZIKV replication (Xu et al, Nature Medicine 2016).

CDK19 belongs to the CDK (cyclin-dependent kinase) superfamily; however, in contrast to the cell-cycle regulating roles of most CDKs, CDK19 belongs to a subset of CDKs that can regulate gene expression via phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II. Although several CDK19 inhibitors have been described, all of these small molecules also target CDK8, the paralog of CDK19. Importantly, these inhibitors have not progressed to clinical studies due to toxicity issues, possibly related to the broad expression pattern of CDK8 and the non-selective nature of these molecules. In contrast to CDK8, CDK19 is expressed in a tissue-selective manner and disruption to the gene in mice is non-lethal. The goal of this project to identify compounds that can selectively target CDK19 with minimal cross-reactivity with other CDKs through a de novo chemical screen of compounds from NCATS collections.

As the disease progresses, cancer cells metastasize from the pancreas to other parts of the body. Despite substantial improvements in cancer patient survival, metastatic diseases remain ineffectively treated. The majority of pancreatic cancer patients are diagnosed only after the cancer has spread, and nearly all patients succumb to the metastatic burden. The lead collaborators have identified a cellular target that is prevalent in metastatic cancer cells, and identified a compound that inhibits the metastatic process. The aim of this project is to continue to develop this therapy to prepare it for human trials.","Summary":"The perinucleolar compartment (PNC) is a subcellular structure whose formation closely associates with metastatic potential of cancer cells. PNCs are located at the nucleolar periphery, and are dynamic subnuclear bodies enriched with RNA transcripts and RNA-binding proteins. The PNC is highly prevalent in metastatic tumors, metastatically transformed cancer cell lines, and in cancer stem cells. It is rarely found in normal cells, including human embryonic stem cells. A high PNC prevalence positively correlates with disease progression (stages and grades) in tested primary tumors, including breast, colorectal and ovarian cancers, and inversely correlates with patient outcomes. Current evidence indicates that PNC prevalence reflects the metastatic capability of a given cellular population derived from solid tissue origins.\n\nReduction of PNC prevalence was used as a phenotypic marker to screen for compounds that interfere with cellular mechanisms essential for the metastatic capability of cancer cells. This led to the discovery of a compound that was further optimized in a medicinal chemistry campaign to produce metarrestin, a compound that reduces PNC prevalence in multiple cell lines without significant impact on cell viability. It shows anti-oncogenic properties in vitro, including inhibition of migration and invasion. Metarrestin demonstrates desirable pharmacokinetic properties and bioavailability, and in an animal model of pancreatic metastasis, metarrestin significantly reduced metastatic burden in the lung and liver and extended survival.\n\nThe team is collaborating on the completion of the following studies for metarrestin:\n- Formulation development\n- Method development for analysis of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) material\n- Manufacture of GMP drug product\n- Bioanalytical method development\n- Stability studies\n- Investigational New Drug (IND)-directed toxicology"},{"Report Title":"Using the Preimplantation Factor (PIF) to Treat Graft-versus-Host Disease","NIH Project ID":"","ZIA ID Number":"TR000279-02","NCATS Division":"","2018 Project Status ":"Active","2019 Project Status ":"","Lead Investigators":["Alimardanov, Asaf"],"Supervisor of Record":["Simeonov, Anton"],"NCATS Team Members":["Bourdi, Mohammed","Jin, Haksong","Joshi, Pramod","Terse, Pramod"],"Intramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":["indicated, none"],"Extramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":"Eytan Barnea, MD BioIncept, LLC\n","Does project use human cells, human subjects or human tissues?":"Neither human cells nor tissues\n","Keywords":"","Distinguishing Keyword":"","Goals and Objectives":"A number of diseases arise due to defects in bone marrow cells. Such conditions may be treated through bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a major complication that can occur after BMT. The transplanted cells from the donor (graft) treat the cells of the patient (host) as foreign. Instead of helping the recipient, the immune cells from the donor graft will then attack the cells, tissues and organs of the host, as if fighting an infection. Acute GVHD soon after transplant can be mild, moderate, severe, or even fatal if not controlled. The disease may also present as a later-onset chronic condition. Chronic GVHD therapy is associated with a lifetime of treatment with immune-suppressive drugs that can have long-term side effects and toxicities. The preimplantation factor (PIF), a peptide normally present during early stages of viable pregnancy, was demonstrated to protect against GVHD. Initial findings suggest that PIF could be useful against the range of adverse effects that develop acutely and chronically after BMT, which may make the overall procedure more feasible, rather than a last resort. The aim of this project is to continue development of PIF to prepare it for human trials in GVHD patients.","Summary":"Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is a well-established approach to the treatment of malignant and non-malignant hematopoietic diseases, although it is considered as a last resort. Even when using matched donors, many patients develop graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which, when not fatal, can progress to a chronic, lifelong condition. Current treatments include immune suppressive agents and steroids, although these regimens do not work for all patients. The preimplantation factor (PIF) is an evolutionarily-conserved peptide that accompanies and supports viable embryo development, regulating inflammation, immunity and transplant acceptance. PIF has been shown to regulate several pro-inflammatory genes and proteins, to block activated T-cell proliferation, and to reduce oxidative stress. \n\nSynthetic PIF (sPIF) activity was assessed following BMT. Short-term, low-dose administration of sPIF in preclinical models was shown to promote and sustain engraftment of donor bone marrow cells, prevent the development of GVHD, preserve the beneficial graft versus leukemia effect, and significantly reduce overall mortality. PIF treatment led to protection against dermatitis, hepatitis, and colon ulceration, the three classic hallmarks of GVHD. PIF treatment reduced mortality following allogeneic BMT from an unrelated donor, and promoted long-term cellular engraftment in syngeneic transplant from a genetically identical donor. These findings suggest that PIF could be useful against the range of adverse effects that develop acutely and chronically after BMT, which may make the overall procedure more feasible, rather than a last resort.\n\nThe team is collaborating on the completion of the following studies for PIF:\n- Synthesis of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) material\n- Investigational New Drug (IND)-directed toxicology\n"},{"Report Title":"Therapy for Fuchs Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy","NIH Project ID":"","ZIA ID Number":"TR000280-02","NCATS Division":"","2018 Project Status ":"Active","2019 Project Status ":"","Lead Investigators":["Sanderson, Philip"],"Supervisor of Record":["Simeonov, Anton"],"NCATS Team Members":["Alimardanov, Asaf","Chen, Catherine","Cradock, James","Tawa, Gregory","Terse, Pramod","Wagner, Erik"],"Intramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":["indicated, none"],"Extramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":"Michael Blaber Trefoil Therapeutics, Inc.\nRalph Bradshaw Trefoil Therapeutics, Inc.\nDavid Eveleth Trefoil Therapeutics, Inc.\nAdriana Manzi Trefoil Therapeutics, Inc.\nBrian Short Trefoil Therapeutics, Inc.\nKen Thomas Trefoil Therapeutics, Inc.\n","Does project use human cells, human subjects or human tissues?":"Neither human cells nor tissues\n","Keywords":"","Distinguishing Keyword":"","Goals and Objectives":"Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is a degenerative disease of the eye. The front surface of the eye, the cornea, helps regulate vision by focusing light onto the lens. FECD affects the thin layer of cells at the back of the cornea, which progressively become damaged and die. As these cells are lost, the cornea retains excess fluid, resulting in loss of optical quality and decreased vision. Most patients are diagnosed with FECD only after significant numbers of corneal cells have been lost, and the only treatment for advanced disease is corneal transplantation. The lead collaborators have developed a growth factor therapy that aims to halt, and potentially reverse, the degeneration of endothelial cells. The purpose of this project is to support further preclinical development and enable clinical trials.","Summary":"Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is marked by progressive degeneration of the monolayer of endothelial cells on the inner surface of the cornea. Extracellular matrix accumulates between the corneal stroma and the endothelial layer at Descemets membrane, leading to corneal edema, loss of optical quality, and decreased vision. FECD is slowly progressive, and patients do not seek treatment until the endothelial layer is badly degenerated. Transplantation is the only current treatment. However, donor corneas are in limited supply, surgical complications can be significant, and transplants due to endothelial dystrophy have a higher long-term failure rate. A more optimal therapy would avoid the need for transplantation altogether. \n\nFibroblast growth factors (FGFs) have been shown to stimulate proliferation and migration of human corneal endothelial cells in vitro and have the potential to be regenerative therapies in vivo.

More than 90% of the drugs being developed fail because of lack of efficacy or unexpected toxicity in clinical trials. The high failure rate in the late stages of clinical development is in large part due to the use of overly simplistic in vitro cell assays and in vivo animal models with limited predictive value during the various stages of drug discovery. Bioprinting of architecturally defined and physiologically relevant human tissues is emerging as a key enabling technology for drug discovery. Bioprinting is the process of creating three-dimensional (3D) multi cell patterns of defined architecture using 3D printing technologies, where native cellular functions and viability are preserved within the printed tissue. Generally, tissue bioprinting utilizes the layer-by-layer, additive manufacturing techniques to create human, native tissue-like structures for drug discovery and therapeutic applications. Bioprinting integrates advances in tissue engineering technologies and cell biology with the development of 3D bioprinters, biocompatible polymers and hydrogels and non-invasive methods to validate the morphology and function of human tissues. The goal of the Tissue Bioprinting program at NCATS is to generate architecturally defined human microtissues that closely resemble native human tissues in wells of a microplate as disease relevant models for drug screening. The objective of the Tissue Bioprinting program is to produce disease relevant 3D organotypic disease models using 3D Bioprinting technologies by first preparing normal tissues and then plugging in different disease relevant iPSC derived cells, disease primary cells, stressors, immune cells, pharmacological treatments, and study the effects on the tissue physiology, morphology, remodeling, cell differentiation, and tissue function in general. NCATS has a unique libraries of chemical agents that can be used as stressors, as well as libraries of pharmacological agents, including approved drugs and mechanistically annotated compounds, which we use to repurpose existing therapies and to understand the pharmacology underlying diseases, respectively.","Summary":"The activities of the Tissue Bioprinting program include: i) Develop bioprinting protocols to fabricate native-like, functional human tissues. Ii) Validate of printed tissues: develop morphological and physiological biomarkers of tissue architecture and function by using microscopy, histology, gene sequencing, electrophysiological and other methodologies. iii) Use printed tissues for the screening of focused libraries of compounds for drug discovery. iv) Develop a framework for the sharing of validated protocols as a readily available resource for researchers to exchange data on optimized conditions for bioinks, culture techniques, cell types, and software tools as well as techniques to quantify and validate printed tissues. \nBioprinting of tissue models for pain, opioid addiction and relapse: As part of the Trans-NIH Opioid Initiative, the 3D Tissue bioprinting group will establish tissue models for testing compounds for the treatment of pain and addiction. Currently, a prototype of a human blood brain barrier (BBB) tissue model containing microvasculature, pericytes, and astrocytes in a multiwell format is been developed based on published protocols. As interactions with the BBB are keys to understanding opioid transport, we will introduce opioid into the microvessels of the brain model and study opioid transport across the BBB. A 3D brain model that includes dopaminergic, GABAergic and glutaminergic neurons derived from human iPSCs will be developed as models for addiction. In addition to the human brain model, the 3D biofabrication platform will also enable the development of tissues containing sensory neurons and cells involved in the inflammatory response which will allow the development of tissue models for testing the effect of compounds in pain sensation and resolution. In addition to the NCATS intramural efforts, participating ICs may choose to issue supplements to existing extramural grants to advance the creation of 3D bioprinted tissue models."},{"Report Title":"HEAL: Probe/Drug Lead Production","NIH Project ID":"","ZIA ID Number":"TR000346-01","NCATS Division":"","2018 Project Status ":"Active","2019 Project Status ":"","Lead Investigators":["Hall, Matthew"],"Supervisor of Record":["Simeonov, Anton"],"NCATS Team Members":["indicated, none"],"Intramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":["indicated, none"],"Extramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":"none indicated","Does project use human cells, human subjects or human tissues?":"Neither human cells nor tissues\n","Keywords":"","Distinguishing Keyword":"","Goals and Objectives":"The Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) Initiative is a trans-NIH effort launched in April 2018 to advance national priorities in addressing the opioid crisis through science.

The NCATS Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC) will work with IC and extramural partners to apply disease biology insights and develop pharmacological probes (alternatively termed drug leads) for novel targets related to pain, addiction and overdose; by leveraging expertise in assay design, quantitative high-throughput screening and medicinal chemistry, NCGC aims to develop high quality probes for testing in both animal and human-based efficacy platforms.","Summary":"The opioid crisis highlights the urgent need for novel non-addictive pain medications, as well as improved treatments for opioid addiction and overdose. There is a need for pharmacological agents directed at novel targets to test new therapeutic hypotheses, new clinic-ready drugs directed at those targets, and new testing systems with the potential to be more predictive of human clinical response than traditionally used models. This initiative proposes to develop and employ novel chemistry, screening, and testing methodologies to discover new pharmacological tools and investigational drugs for pain, addiction, and overdose. \n\nRemarkable advances in our understanding of the molecular and neural circuit physiology of pain, addiction, and overdose have suggested many putative approaches for therapeutic intervention. Very few of these are considered validated\"; most lack sufficient data to merit the considerable resources required to develop a new drug. Lack of validation is due largely to a combination of absence of drug-like pharmacological probes for novel targets which allow testing of new therapeutic hypotheses, lack of preclinical models sufficient to reliably predict human responses, and lack of market attractiveness (for treatments for addiction and overdose). This project intends to de-risk novel targets for pain, addiction, and overdose by creating preclinical pharmacological probes for novel targets.\n\nNCGC will utilize its highly diverse small molecule libraries, including a comprehensive collection of approved drugs, a collection of over 2,000 compounds that represent diverse mechanisms, a large collection of over 8,000 pharmacologically annotated investigational drugs including tool compounds that target epigenetic modulators, a comprehensive screening collection of &RT; 200,000 drug-like small molecules, and several collections of purified natural products including those from NCI and FIC. NCATS has multiyear experience performing quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) that enables generation of dose response curves for every compound, thus providing unique and rich datasets. Using cheminformatics tools and counterscreen/confirmatory assays, NCGC medicinal chemists will collaborate with partnering investigators to optimize promising compounds to improve potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic properties. These probe compounds will be further optimized through testing in advanced efficacy assays, with a view to moving these leads closer to the clinic as future therapies for pain, addiction, and overdose.\n"},{"Report Title":"Identification of antagonists for GPR17 receptor","NIH Project ID":"","ZIA ID Number":"TR000348-01","NCATS Division":"","2018 Project Status ":"Active","2019 Project Status ":"","Lead Investigators":["Hall, Matthew","Shen, Min"],"Supervisor of Record":["Simeonov, Anton"],"NCATS Team Members":["Zhu, Hu"],"Intramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":["indicated, none"],"Extramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":"Hongxia Ren Indiana University\n","Does project use human cells, human subjects or human tissues?":"Neither human cells nor tissues\n","Keywords":"","Distinguishing Keyword":"","Goals and Objectives":"Metabolic diseases such as diabetes and obesity affect millions of individuals in the US, leading to significant morbidity and mortality.

In three of the 10 forms of HPS, patients develop pulmonary fibrosis (PF), in which tissues deep in the lungs become scarred, interfering with the ability to breathe. PF is a leading cause of premature death in adults with HPS, and there are no treatments approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for HPS-PF. Scientists from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) jointly identified that increased activity of two biological pathways contributes to the development of lung fibrosis in HPS-PF. The lead collaborators discovered that these two pathways in the body can be blocked by a single drug molecule, offering protection against lung fibrosis in animal models of HPS. This project will further develop this drug candidate for clinical testing in patients.","Summary":"Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome is a rare genetic disorder primarily of lysosome-related organelle biogenesis. There are 10 different types of HPS, depending on which genetic mutation is inherited. Patients with HPS-1, HPS-2 or HPS-4 develop pulmonary fibrosis. In the absence of a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapy for HPS-PF, there is an urgent need to identify new therapeutic targets and treatment strategies. \n\nIt has been shown that the cannabinoid-1 receptor (CB1R) is overactivated in fibrotic lung tissue of mice and humans with HPS. In previous studies, rimonabant, a CB1R antagonist, demonstrated a modest ability to mitigate fibrosis in animal models. However, neuropsychiatric side effects of CB1R inhibition in the central nervous system (CNS) led to rimonabant being withdrawn from all clinical use. Additionally, the activity of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is also increased in PF, promoting lung inflammation and progression of fibrosis. Because the pathogenesis of HPS-PF is complex, targeting multiple pathways has been recommended as an approach to improve therapeutic efficacy. \n\nTo target these independent drivers of PF simultaneously in HPS, the novel drug candidate MRI-1867 was designed as a dual inhibitor of both CB1R and iNOS. To avoid the CNS side effects, MRI-1867 was designed to be restricted to only the peripheral tissues. MRI-1867 is orally bioavailable, and in chronic treatment in animal models of PF it provided increased antifibrotic efficacy compared with targeting either CB1R or iNOS alone.\n\nTRND scientists are developing a synthetic process and a suitable formulation for manufacturing MRI-1867; developing and validating the analytical and bioanalytical assays necessary to evaluate the drug product; and conducting pre-clinical pharmacokinetics, safety and toxicology studies that will enable the collaborators to submit an Investigational New Drug application with the FDA to initiate a Phase I clinical trial."},{"Report Title":"Synthesis of non-brain-permeant inhibitor of LZK","NIH Project ID":"","ZIA ID Number":"TR000357-01","NCATS Division":"","2018 Project Status ":"Active","2019 Project Status ":"","Lead Investigators":["Hall, Matthew","Shen, Min"],"Supervisor of Record":["Simeonov, Anton"],"NCATS Team Members":["Patnaik, Samarjit","Wan, Kanny"],"Intramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":[],"Extramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":"none indicated","Does project use human cells, human subjects or human tissues?":"Neither human cells nor tissues\n","Keywords":"","Distinguishing Keyword":"","Goals and Objectives":"LZK has been identified as a novel therapeutic target in head and neck cancer.

For Klebsiella pneumoniae, the relevant capsule is a high molecular weight polymer. Antibodies to these capsules, for instance, led to significantly more rapid resolution of the infection, and lower capsule synthesis improved phagocytosis. The specific capsules made by different strains often vary, again providing a way to avoid immune surveillance by the host. However, the regulatory mechanisms that control synthesis are significantly less subject to variation. The capsules of Klebsiella are under the control of the Rcs regulatory cascade, first identified and studied extensively in the Gottesman lab in E. coli. All the major regulatory elements are conserved in Klebsiella, with >75% identity with the proteins found in E. coli. Mutations in the RcsB positive regulator for this cascade totally block capsule synthesis. Null mutations in a negative regulator (named IgaA in Salmonella) are lethal in both Salmonella and E. coli, apparently because a product or products activated by the Rcs system are lethal. Mutations that bypass lethality are in the positive regulator (RcsB) or intermediate signaling steps.

Pharmacokinetic parameter calculation and simulation.\n\nExamples of the DMPK group contributions to recent projects within the Therapeutic Development Branch include:\n\nProof of Concept (POC) Study for Creatine Transporter Deficiency (CTD): \nCyclocreatine (Ccr) has been proposed as a drug candidate for the treatment of CTD. Our in vitro ADME data on membrane permeability did not support the original therapeutic hypothesis of passive diffusion of Ccr into the brain in the absence of the creatine transporter (CT). To address this issue, we designed a series of PK and tissue distribution studies with radiolabeled Ccr in CT KO mice. Our data demonstrated that 14-CCcr enters the brain after oral administration but at a very low level. However, once in the brain tissue, 14-CCcr is eliminated very slowly with a long half-life (t1/2) of 28 days. Thus, after multiple dose treatment, Ccr will accumulate in the brain to yield a concentration high enough to provide the beneficial effects observed in the CT KO mice. This proof of concept study enhanced our understanding of brain uptake for Ccr and led the team to advance this project to clinical trials. \n\n\nApplying Metabolite Identification (MetID) to Guide Structure Optimization: \nTo develop a novel therapy for fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), a lead compound (LDN-189) was proposed as a development candidate by our collaborator. However, based on our past experience with similar chemical structures, we immediately realized that this molecule could have metabolic issues associated with toxicity. To confirm this, we conducted extensive MetID experiments, and several metabolic liable spots (red flags) were identified. The formation of major metabolite, NIH-Q55, was mediated by aldehyde oxidase (AO), an enzyme known to be species-dependent. AO enzyme activity (greatest to least) could be ranked in the order of monkey &RT; human &RT; rodents. Dog, a common non-rodent species used for drug safety evaluation, totally lacks AO activity. The AO-mediated metabolism could also contribute to a large variability in exposures observed among different human subjects. In addition to the AO-mediated metabolism, the piperazinyl moiety was the target of NADPH-dependent metabolism, resulting in reactive iminium intermediates as confirmed through chemical trapping experiments. Two aniline metabolites were also detected, which brought up concerns about drug safety. These findings provided valuable information to the chemists, guiding subsequent structure modifications to generate safer drug candidates. By blocking the AO-mediated metabolic site and changing the piperazinyl moiety, the chemists were able to develop new lead compounds with more metabolic stability and less toxicity, while retaining pharmacological activity. Currently, the lead collaborators on this project are on track to file an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to begin clinical trials.\n\n\nOptimization of Dosing Regimen for Fungal Infection Treatment: \nVT-1129 is a potent antifungal agent with a slow absorption phase followed by a slow elimination phase in the PK profile after oral administration. In order to deliver a high initial drug concentration for a quick kill on fungus while avoiding significant drug accumulation in tissues (especially liver) after multiple-dose treatment, we proposed a dosing regimen with a high loading dose, followed by low daily maintenance doses. A series of simulations were conducted with different dosage combinations. The predicted drug concentrations based on simulations were confirmed by in vivo measured concentrations in mice. The optimized dosing regimen was successfully used in subsequent mouse efficacy studies, supporting a successful IND application to the FDA.\n\n\n"},{"Report Title":"Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism","NIH Project ID":"","ZIA ID Number":"TR000369-01","NCATS Division":"","2018 Project Status ":"Active","2019 Project Status ":"","Lead Investigators":["Simeonov, Anton","Xu, Xin"],"Supervisor of Record":["undefined, n/a"],"NCATS Team Members":["Dunn, Garrett","Gonzalez, Eric","Kabir, Md","Padilha, Elias","Shah, Pranav","Wagner, Erik","Qiu, Amy"],"Intramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":["PhD, Resat","DVM, Michael","DVM, David","Rudloff, Udo"],"Extramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":"Alexander Agoulnik Florida International University\nDavid Bettoun Chondrial Therapeutics, Inc.\nRobert Davis Lumos Pharma, Inc.\nDavid Eveleth Trefoil Therapeutics, Inc.\nEnrico Garattini, MD Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri\nCornelis Hop, PhD Genentech\nMaria Irene Kontaridis, PhD Harvard Medical School, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center\nR.

Thus, after multiple dose treatment, Ccr will accumulate in the brain to yield a concentration high enough to provide the beneficial effects observed in the CT KO mice. This proof of concept study enhanced our understanding of brain uptake for Ccr and led the team to advance this project to clinical trials. \n\n\nApplying Metabolite Identification (MetID) to Guide Structure Optimization: \nTo develop a novel therapy for fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), a lead compound (LDN-189) was proposed as a development candidate by our collaborator. However, based on our past experience with similar chemical structures, we immediately realized that this molecule could have metabolic issues associated with toxicity. To confirm this, we conducted extensive MetID experiments, and several metabolic liable spots (red flags) were identified. The formation of major metabolite, NIH-Q55, was mediated by aldehyde oxidase (AO), an enzyme known to be species-dependent. AO enzyme activity (greatest to least) could be ranked in the order of monkey &RT; human &RT; rodents. Dog, a common non-rodent species used for drug safety evaluation, totally lacks AO activity. The AO-mediated metabolism could also contribute to a large variability in exposures observed among different human subjects. In addition to the AO-mediated metabolism, the piperazinyl moiety was the target of NADPH-dependent metabolism, resulting in reactive iminium intermediates as confirmed through chemical trapping experiments. Two aniline metabolites were also detected, which brought up concerns about drug safety. These findings provided valuable information to the chemists, guiding subsequent structure modifications to generate safer drug candidates. By blocking the AO-mediated metabolic site and changing the piperazinyl moiety, the chemists were able to develop new lead compounds with more metabolic stability and less toxicity, while retaining pharmacological activity. Currently, the lead collaborators on this project are on track to file an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to begin clinical trials.\n\n\nOptimization of Dosing Regimen for Fungal Infection Treatment: \nVT-1129 is a potent antifungal agent with a slow absorption phase followed by a slow elimination phase in the PK profile after oral administration. In order to deliver a high initial drug concentration for a quick kill on fungus while avoiding significant drug accumulation in tissues (especially liver) after multiple-dose treatment, we proposed a dosing regimen with a high loading dose, followed by low daily maintenance doses. A series of simulations were conducted with different dosage combinations. The predicted drug concentrations based on simulations were confirmed by in vivo measured concentrations in mice. The optimized dosing regimen was successfully used in subsequent mouse efficacy studies, supporting a successful IND application to the FDA.\n\n\n"},{"Report Title":"Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism","NIH Project ID":"","ZIA ID Number":"TR000369-01","NCATS Division":"","2018 Project Status ":"Active","2019 Project Status ":"","Lead Investigators":["Simeonov, Anton","Xu, Xin"],"Supervisor of Record":["undefined, n/a"],"NCATS Team Members":["Dunn, Garrett","Gonzalez, Eric","Kabir, Md","Padilha, Elias","Shah, Pranav","Wagner, Erik","Qiu, Amy"],"Intramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":["PhD, Resat","DVM, Michael","DVM, David","Rudloff, Udo"],"Extramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":"Alexander Agoulnik Florida International University\nDavid Bettoun Chondrial Therapeutics, Inc.\nRobert Davis Lumos Pharma, Inc.\nDavid Eveleth Trefoil Therapeutics, Inc.\nEnrico Garattini, MD Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri\nCornelis Hop, PhD Genentech\nMaria Irene Kontaridis, PhD Harvard Medical School, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center\nR.

Our in vitro ADME data on membrane permeability did not support the original therapeutic hypothesis of passive diffusion of Ccr into the brain in the absence of the creatine transporter (CT). To address this issue, we designed a series of PK and tissue distribution studies with radiolabeled Ccr in CT KO mice. Our data demonstrated that 14-CCcr enters the brain after oral administration but at a very low level. However, once in the brain tissue, 14-CCcr is eliminated very slowly with a long half-life (t1/2) of 28 days. Thus, after multiple dose treatment, Ccr will accumulate in the brain to yield a concentration high enough to provide the beneficial effects observed in the CT KO mice. This proof of concept study enhanced our understanding of brain uptake for Ccr and led the team to advance this project to clinical trials. \n\n\nApplying Metabolite Identification (MetID) to Guide Structure Optimization: \nTo develop a novel therapy for fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), a lead compound (LDN-189) was proposed as a development candidate by our collaborator. However, based on our past experience with similar chemical structures, we immediately realized that this molecule could have metabolic issues associated with toxicity. To confirm this, we conducted extensive MetID experiments, and several metabolic liable spots (red flags) were identified. The formation of major metabolite, NIH-Q55, was mediated by aldehyde oxidase (AO), an enzyme known to be species-dependent. AO enzyme activity (greatest to least) could be ranked in the order of monkey &RT; human &RT; rodents. Dog, a common non-rodent species used for drug safety evaluation, totally lacks AO activity. The AO-mediated metabolism could also contribute to a large variability in exposures observed among different human subjects. In addition to the AO-mediated metabolism, the piperazinyl moiety was the target of NADPH-dependent metabolism, resulting in reactive iminium intermediates as confirmed through chemical trapping experiments. Two aniline metabolites were also detected, which brought up concerns about drug safety. These findings provided valuable information to the chemists, guiding subsequent structure modifications to generate safer drug candidates. By blocking the AO-mediated metabolic site and changing the piperazinyl moiety, the chemists were able to develop new lead compounds with more metabolic stability and less toxicity, while retaining pharmacological activity. Currently, the lead collaborators on this project are on track to file an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to begin clinical trials.\n\n\nOptimization of Dosing Regimen for Fungal Infection Treatment: \nVT-1129 is a potent antifungal agent with a slow absorption phase followed by a slow elimination phase in the PK profile after oral administration. In order to deliver a high initial drug concentration for a quick kill on fungus while avoiding significant drug accumulation in tissues (especially liver) after multiple-dose treatment, we proposed a dosing regimen with a high loading dose, followed by low daily maintenance doses. A series of simulations were conducted with different dosage combinations. The predicted drug concentrations based on simulations were confirmed by in vivo measured concentrations in mice. The optimized dosing regimen was successfully used in subsequent mouse efficacy studies, supporting a successful IND application to the FDA.\n\n\n"},{"Report Title":"Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism","NIH Project ID":"","ZIA ID Number":"TR000369-01","NCATS Division":"","2018 Project Status ":"Active","2019 Project Status ":"","Lead Investigators":["Simeonov, Anton","Xu, Xin"],"Supervisor of Record":["undefined, n/a"],"NCATS Team Members":["Dunn, Garrett","Gonzalez, Eric","Kabir, Md","Padilha, Elias","Shah, Pranav","Wagner, Erik","Qiu, Amy"],"Intramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":["PhD, Resat","DVM, Michael","DVM, David","Rudloff, Udo"],"Extramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":"Alexander Agoulnik Florida International University\nDavid Bettoun Chondrial Therapeutics, Inc.\nRobert Davis Lumos Pharma, Inc.\nDavid Eveleth Trefoil Therapeutics, Inc.\nEnrico Garattini, MD Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri\nCornelis Hop, PhD Genentech\nMaria Irene Kontaridis, PhD Harvard Medical School, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center\nR.

Our in vitro ADME data on membrane permeability did not support the original therapeutic hypothesis of passive diffusion of Ccr into the brain in the absence of the creatine transporter (CT). To address this issue, we designed a series of PK and tissue distribution studies with radiolabeled Ccr in CT KO mice. Our data demonstrated that 14-CCcr enters the brain after oral administration but at a very low level. However, once in the brain tissue, 14-CCcr is eliminated very slowly with a long half-life (t1/2) of 28 days. Thus, after multiple dose treatment, Ccr will accumulate in the brain to yield a concentration high enough to provide the beneficial effects observed in the CT KO mice.

However, based on our past experience with similar chemical structures, we immediately realized that this molecule could have metabolic issues associated with toxicity. To confirm this, we conducted extensive MetID experiments, and several metabolic liable spots (red flags) were identified. The formation of major metabolite, NIH-Q55, was mediated by aldehyde oxidase (AO), an enzyme known to be species-dependent. AO enzyme activity (greatest to least) could be ranked in the order of monkey &RT; human &RT; rodents. Dog, a common non-rodent species used for drug safety evaluation, totally lacks AO activity. The AO-mediated metabolism could also contribute to a large variability in exposures observed among different human subjects. In addition to the AO-mediated metabolism, the piperazinyl moiety was the target of NADPH-dependent metabolism, resulting in reactive iminium intermediates as confirmed through chemical trapping experiments. Two aniline metabolites were also detected, which brought up concerns about drug safety. These findings provided valuable information to the chemists, guiding subsequent structure modifications to generate safer drug candidates. By blocking the AO-mediated metabolic site and changing the piperazinyl moiety, the chemists were able to develop new lead compounds with more metabolic stability and less toxicity, while retaining pharmacological activity. Currently, the lead collaborators on this project are on track to file an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to begin clinical trials.\n\n\nOptimization of Dosing Regimen for Fungal Infection Treatment: \nVT-1129 is a potent antifungal agent with a slow absorption phase followed by a slow elimination phase in the PK profile after oral administration.

Introduction of a staple, a chemical moiety covalently linking two amino acids in the peptide backbone, induces alpha-helicity in the peptide. Alpha-helices are involved in molecular recognition in several biological interactions, including protein-protein interactions that, as a class, are strongly linked to disease but are not readily druggable. Stapled peptides are a promising technology, especially for making inhibitors of protein-protein interactions, although progress has been limited (only one compound has reached the clinic). One reason could be that stapled peptides are not typical drug-like molecules. In addition, most of the literature on stapled peptides is on hydrocarbon staples, limiting the chemical space that has been explored. In this project, we are modifying the staples by introducing various chemical moieties. The goal is to develop a medicinal chemistry understanding of how various chemical features correlate to the induction of helical conformation, as well as their physicochemical and drug-like properties. The next objective would be to introduce optimized staples into peptide constructs of some target proteins (e.g., BCL2, MDM2 and NOTCH-CSL), to make their inhibitors.","Summary":"We are designing peptides with novel staples incorporating a variety of chemical moieties, such as aromatic and heteroaromatic rings, H-bond donors and acceptors, alkynes, alkenes, etc. These designs are first evaluated by computational chemistry for the induction of alpha-helicity and for physical properties (logP, PSA, etc.). Additionally, we are developing a novel synthetic approach, in which we first construct the staple as a bis-amino acid synthon (two amino acids linked through a staple) that is then used in automated peptide synthesis. Our approach differs from the current literature, in which staples are made after the peptide has been synthesized. This current approach limits the chemical diversity of the staples, whereas our novel approach should open up greater synthetic chemistry options for making staples (e.g., Suzuki reaction, reductive amination, etc.), increasing the diversity of chemical moieties that could be incorporated. \n\nWe have optimized all the synthetic steps for our new approach. Adaptation of this approach to automatic peptide synthesis is near completion. Once that is achieved, we will have a high-throughput synthesis available to quickly generate a variety of stapled peptides for further evaluation. This project represents the first use of automated peptide synthesis technology at NCATS, which is now available to all groups in the intramural program."},{"Report Title":"HDAC/PI3K Dual Inhibitors for Treatment of Rare Cancers","NIH Project ID":"","ZIA ID Number":"TR000371-01","NCATS Division":"","2018 Project Status ":"Active","2019 Project Status ":"","Lead Investigators":["Grewal, Gurmit"],"Supervisor of Record":["Simeonov, Anton"],"NCATS Team Members":["Danchik, Carina","James, Mark","Lee, Tobie","Tawa, Gregory","Thakur, Ashish"],"Intramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":["indicated, none"],"Extramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":"Surender Kharbanda, PhD NanoLead, Inc.\nHarpal Singh, PhD NanoLead, Inc.\n","Does project use human cells, human subjects or human tissues?":"Neither human cells nor tissues\n","Keywords":"","Distinguishing Keyword":"","Goals and Objectives":"Single target based therapeutic approaches for treatment of cancer suffer from two major limitations, insufficient efficacy and developed resistance. There is strong evidence in the literature suggesting that simultaneous inhibition of two or more targets (or pathways) could address these limitations. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are key regulators of the cell cycle. They function through regulating expression of tumor suppressors (p21 and p27), c-Myc and cyclin D1. Dysregulation of HDACs is implicated in cancer initiation and proliferation. Inhibition of HDACs causes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, with HDAC inhibition emerging as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of several cancers. Dysregulated receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling is also linked to many cancers. Activation of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) pathways causes reduced activity of p21 and p27 and increased expression of c-Myc and cyclin D1, which in turn promote cell proliferation, survival and angiogenesis. Often, activation of these pathways is driven by the activation of their downstream kinases. Inhibition of several of these kinases is an established cancer treatment approach. In many human cancers, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is activated, causing up-regulation of the EGF receptor (EGFR) pathway. Simultaneous inhibition of both HDAC and RTK pathways should synergistically inhibit tumor growth. Recently, it has been reported that the combination of an HDAC inhibitor and a kinase inhibitor, such as an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor or PI3K inhibitor, overcomes kinase inhibitor resistance and induces apoptosis in human several cancers in a synergistic manner. This synergy should achieve greater efficacy at a lower dose, hence lessening the potential for toxicities and improving the overall therapeutic window. In this project, we aim to translate these discoveries toward the development of novel HDAC/PI3K dual inhibitors for the treatment of selected rare cancers. In parallel, we are collaborating with NanoLead, Inc., a nano-particle formulation company. Nano-particle formulation technology is showing potential for improved cell permeability, tumor targeting and drug pharmacokinetics. Through this collaboration, we are facilitating the development of this platform technology in the context of lead optimization for the dual inhibitors.","Summary":"We have been designing and synthesizing novel PI3K and HDAC dual inhibitors. Using a matrix approach to screen compounds across a range of concentrations, we have discovered several molecules that inhibit both PI3K and HDAC with single digit nanomolar potency. Several selected compounds have been tested in the NCI60 cell line panel, showing anti-proliferation and cell-killing activity in several cell lines. Selected compounds were examined in cell-based target engagement assays, confirming that the dual inhibitors engage both PI3K-delta and HDAC6 in cells. \n\nWe have successfully developed a nano-particle formulation for one of our front-runner compounds. Formulation for another promising compound is ongoing. Once these two formulations are in-hand, we will evaluate them in in vitro and in vivo assays."},{"Report Title":"Development of novel antimalarial targets and combination therapies to address drug resistance","NIH Project ID":"","ZIA ID Number":"TR000245-03","NCATS Division":"","2018 Project Status ":"Active","2019 Project Status ":"","Lead Investigators":["Thomas, Craig"],"Supervisor of Record":["Simeonov, Anton"],"NCATS Team Members":["Eastman, Richard"],"Intramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":["Fairhurst, Rick","PhD, Xinzhuan"],"Extramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":"Paul D Roepe, PhD Department of Chemistry and Program in Tumor Biolo, Lombardi Cancer Center, Georgetown University\n","Does project use human cells, human subjects or human tissues?":"Neither human cells nor tissues\n","Keywords":"","Distinguishing Keyword":"","Goals and Objectives":"Treatment of the symptomatic asexual stage of Plasmodium falciparum malaria relies almost exclusively on artemisinin (ART) combination therapies (ACTs) in endemic regions.

Most DNA methylation is essential for normal development, and it plays a very important role in a number of key processes including genomic imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, and suppression of repetitive element transcription and transposition and, when dysregulated, contributes to diseases like cancer. Epigenetic hallmarks of cancer include global DNA hypomethylation and locus-specific hypermethylation of CpG islands (CGIs). The two best-known DNMT inhibiting agents, AZA and DAC, are nucleoside analogs that integrate into the DNA and have well-known side-effects including (among others) neutropenia (reduced neutrophil count), fever, and nausea. Both chemicals have been shown to be mutagenic, at least partly due to decomposition in aqueous solution, causing errors of DNA replication and increased breakage of DNA at fragile sites. While the toxic side effects are ameliorated, and anti-cancer properties enhanced, by lowered dosages, these drugs have been found to extend lifespan of leukemia patients by a few months or a year at best. Drugs that more effectively modulate DNA methylation without integrating into DNA, thereby avoiding the toxic or mutagenic side effects of AZA and DAC, are urgently needed. In addition, drugs that specifically modulate DNA methylation of different genomic partitions (coding vs repetitive sequences, for example) or in specific cell types would be powerful therapeutic options.

Pharmacological agents targeting autonomic receptors are commonly used to return this system to homeostasis, but unfortunately these agents often lack selectivity over autonomic receptors at other sites within the body. There are additional mechanisms contributing to both vasoconstriction and vasodilation, an important example being the signaling pathways associated with nitric oxide (NO). While the importance of NO as a vasodilator is well established, the mechanisms that regulate its localization and diffusion are less well-understood. To that end, recent work by Isakson and co-workers identified a NO regulatory pathway localized to vascular endothelial cells of resistance arterioles. These cells communicate with vascular smooth muscle cells via myoendothelial junctions (MEJ) that contain -globin (HBA), a heme-containing protein that complexes with endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). HBA heme iron (Fe2+) appears to catalyze the dioxygenation of NO to NO3-, limiting the diffusion of NO into smooth muscle and exerting a vasoconstrictive effect. The HBA heme iron is maintained in the Fe2+ state by a third protein, cytochrome b5 reductase 3 (CYB5R3). Disruption of the CYB5R3/HBA/eNOS pathway via gene silencing (siRNA) or genetic knock-out of HBA, pharmacological inhibition of CYB5R3, or dissociation of HBA from eNOS with a mimetic peptide leads to increased NOS-dependent NO flux across the MEJ. The mimetic peptide, developed by modeling the putative HBA/eNOS interaction site, lowers blood pressure in wild-type mice but not in eNOS-knock-out mice. This project aims to identify small molecules that, like the mimetic peptide, dissociate HBA from eNOS to increase NO signaling across the MEJ.

During stressful conditions, mitochondrial fusion allows compensatory mixing of functional mitochondrial content with damaged mitochondria. Impaired mitochondrial function has indeed been linked to numerous pathologies. A key regulator in mitochondrial fusion is the Optic Atrophy Protein (OPA1). Fusion-competent OPA1 requires both the long and short forms; loss of the long form leads to impaired fusion. During stress, OPA1 is cleaved to its short form by the zinc metalloprotease OMA1, located within the mitochondrial inner membrane. OMA1 is an ATP-independent protease expressed under stress conditions and over-active OMA1 is pathogenic. Conversely, OMA1-deficient mice exhibit protection from neurodegeneration, renal ischemia, and heart failure, which strongly suggest that OMA1 is a promising therapeutic target. Methods that directly assess OMA1 activity as well as selective OMA1 inhibitors are needed to further understand the precise mechanism of action of OMA1 and its therapeutic potential. The first goal of this project is to adapt and miniaturize a previously developed OMA-1 activity assay to 1,536-well format for high-throughput screening.

Future work will focus on pursuing medicinal chemistry optimization of select hit molecules to further improve their potency, selectivity and other characteristics."},{"Report Title":"Improving 15-LOX-2 small molecule inhibitors through medicinal chemistry and structure-guided design","NIH Project ID":"","ZIA ID Number":"TR000367-01","NCATS Division":"","2018 Project Status ":"Active","2019 Project Status ":"","Lead Investigators":["Simeonov, Anton"],"Supervisor of Record":["undefined, n/a"],"NCATS Team Members":["Luci, Diane","Bantukallu, Ganesha","Tao, Dingyin","Yasgar, Adam","Vladimirovich, Alexey"],"Intramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":["indicated, none"],"Extramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":"Hulya Bayir University of Pittsburgh\nTed Holman University of California, Santa Cruz\nValerian E Kagan University of Pittsburgh\nMarcia Newcomer Louisiana State University\n","Does project use human cells, human subjects or human tissues?":"Neither human cells nor tissues\n","Keywords":"","Distinguishing Keyword":"","Goals and Objectives":"This project aims to build on previous screening work by developing selective and potent 15-LOX-2 inhibitors, specifically ones capable of disrupting the 15-LOX-2/PEBP1 protein-protein complex and modulate ferroptosis both in in vitro and in vivo models.

The pharmaceutical industry has generated many high-quality chemical probes and several of these have been made available to academia. However, probe-associated data and control compounds, such as inactive structurally related molecules (frequently referred to as inactive controls) and their associated data, are generally not accessible. The lack of data and guidance makes it difficult for researchers to decide, which chemical tools to choose. Several pharmaceutical companies have therefore entered into a pre-competitive collaboration with the Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC) to make available a large number of innovative high quality probes, including all probe-associated data, control compounds and recommendations on use, providing both a formidable resource of chemical tools and target-related knowledge (https://openscienceprobes.sgc-frankfurt.de/). Specificity for a particular target is not a requirement for an effective drug: thus, although most of the pharma donated probes have been extensively characterized, they often need to be better adapted for use as a single chemical tool. In particular, no bespoke inactive-analog control compounds have been generated as the progress of the probe compounds within the company is usually followed by extensive SAR across a series of active analogues. Selection and characterization of the inactive control compound is needed to complete a probe package. In addition, control compounds also have to be carefully characterized to weed out promiscuous compounds. Additionally, such inactive control compounds are rarely included in experiments following the positive activity of the main probe, due to cost and other reasons, and are therefore not easily available from suppliers. The goal of this project is to fill the key gap in this precompetitive space by providing appropriate structurally-similar inactive control compounds, which have zero or dramatically reduced activity against the specific target, to complement the high-quality probes donated by the pharmaceutical partners.
